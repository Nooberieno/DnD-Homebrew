# Nightstalker - Shadow Shot Variant
_Masters of the shadows and misdirection_

## Level 3: Shadow Infusion
You gain the ability to channel shadowy energy to bind and hinder your foes. You learn the following techniques  
**Shadow Snare**:  
As a bonus action, you can fire a shadowy tether at a creature within 60 ft. The target must make a Dexterity Saving throw. On a failed save, the target is restrained by shadowy tendrils till the end of its next turn.   
**Shade Step**:  
As a bonus action you step into the shadows, getting out of sight from enemies. You gain the same benefits as using the Hide action

You may use these abilities an amount of times equal to your proficiency modifier, regaining all uses upon finishing a long rest.

## Level 3: Modifiers
You may add a single modifier to both **Shadow Snare** and **Shade Step**

**Shadow Snare** Modifiers:  
- Blood Bound: Tethered enemies share damage, up to a max of 20 damage. Damage dealt to one also deals damage to the other
- Black Hole: Tethered enemies explode when killed dealing 20 or their max hp (whichever is lower) necrotic damage to all creatures within a 5 ft radius  

**Shade Step** Modifiers:  
- Vanish in Smoke: Activating **Shade Step** also gives its benefits to allies within 5 ft of you
- Hunter's Agility: While **Shade Step** is active, gain 20 ft of extra movement speed.
## Level 7: Keen Scout
You gain an additional 20 ft base movement speed. Using the Dash action increase the total movement speed by 20 ft.

**Hunter or Hunted**  
When hitting an enemy with **Shadow Snare** marks it as if targeted by the _Hunter's Mark_ spell, this effect lasts until the end of the day and doesn't require concentration. 

**Shadow Scout**  
Any path that is dimly lit or completely dark counts as your Favored Terrain

## Level 7: Modifiers
You may add a single modifier to both **Hunter or Hunted** and **Shadow Scout**:

**Hunter or Hunted** Modifiers:  
- Necrosis: When a marked enemy dies, regain health equal to 1d6 times your Ranger Level.
- Bloom: When a marked enemy dies, it explodes dealing 25 or their max hp (whichever is lower) necrotic damage to all creatures within a 5 ft radius. (damage stacks with Black Hole)

**Shadow Scout** Modifiers:
-  Over the Horizon: You and all allies within 50 ft are not negatively impacted by traveling at a fast pace when moving through your Favored Terrain
- One with the Abyss: You and all allies within 50 ft are able to move stealthily at a normal pace when moving through your Favored Terrain
## Level 11: Shadow Dominion
**Tethered Dominion**  
When you use **Shadow Snare**, you can choose up to two creatures within 10 feet of the initial target to also be restrained by the shadowy tendrils. These additional targets must make Dexterity saving throws or be restrained until the end of your next turn.

**Way of the Drifter**   
When you use **Shade Step**, you can teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see within dim light or darkness. You can use this ability even if you're not hidden, and doing so grants you advantage on the first attack you make before the end of your turn.

## Level 11: Modifiers
You may add a single modifier to both **Tethered Dominion** and **Way of the Drifter**  
**Tethered Dominion** Modifiers:  
- Umbra Reaper: When you kill a creature restrained by **Shadow Snare**, you can immediately use **Shadow Snare** again without expending a use. This can chain up to your proficiency modifier times per turn.
- Apex Predator: Shooting an enemy twice with **Shadow Snare** guarantees the next attack against it will be a critical hit.

**Way of the Drifter** Modifiers:
- Way of the Fearless: When teleporting with **Shade Step** gain temporary hit points equal to 2 x your ranger level.
- Way of the Nomad: When teleporting with **Shade Step** recover 1 hp for every ft between you and the nearest enemy
## Level 15: Shadow Shot
Summon a large bow of shadows to bind your foes

**Shadow Shot** allows you to summon a **Shadow Snare** at a location within 60 feet that you can see. This snare can bind up to six enemies within a 10 ft radius, dealing 4d10 necrotic damage to each on a failed Dexterity saving throw and half as much on a successful one.

Creatures within the snare's radius must also make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they are restrained by shadowy tendrils until the end of their next turn. While restrained, they take 2d6 necrotic damage at the start of each of their turns.

The **Shadow Snare** persists for up to 1 minute, ending early if your concentration is broken.
Once you use **Shadow Shot**, you cannot do so again until you finish a long rest.
## Level 15: Modifiers
You may add a single modifier to **Shadow Shot**:
- Deadfall: Increase the range of the **Shadow Snare** to 15 ft. **Shadow Shot** now pulls enemies towards the **Shadow Snare**, decreases initial damage to 2d10, but boosts the damage while restrained to 4d6
- Mobius Quiver: Fire **Shadow Shot** up to 3 times, but the range is decreased to a 5 ft radius and all damage dealt by **Shadow Shot** is halved
