## Inflicting Frenzied
Frenzied can be inflicted by some magical weapons, spell or items. Divine afflictions or prolonged influence chaotic/eldritch force can also cause Frenzied. Frenzied gets worse over time if not cured or subdued.

## Effects of Frenzied
Frenzied is measured in 6 levels. For every long rest you take while Frenzied you must make a Wisdom Saving Throw (DC 10 + current Frenzied level). On a failure, the condition worsens by 1 level.

_Notes:_
- _Any roll on the Short-Term Madness table lasts for 1 round inside combat and 1d10 minutes outside of combat_
- _Any roll on the Long-Term Madness table lasts for 1d10 x 10 hours or until you finish a long rest_

| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1     | Your thoughts feel clouded and paranoia sets in. You have disadvantage on Wisdom and Intelligence checks                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 2     | At the start of each of your turns in combat, roll a d6. On a 1, you must use your action to make a melee attack against the nearest creature (enemy or ally).                                                                                                                                               |
| 3     | Roll on the Long-Term Madness table (DMG p. 260) whenever you finish a long rest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 4     | Your brain is overwhelmed by paranoia and rage. You take 1d6 psychic damage at the end of each of your turns and you have disadvantage on Wisdom Saving Throws                                                                                                                                               |
| 5     | Whenever you take damage, roll on the Short-Term Madness table (DMG p. 259). If the result causes you to be incapacitated, you take psychic damage equal to your level. Can only happen once per round in combat                                                                                             |
| 6     | The madness has fully consumed you. You must roll a d20 on the start of each of your turns. On a 10 or lower, you lose control and act according to the DM's choice. On a 1 you drop to 0 hp and die instantly. If you are revived you gain a character flaw from the Indefinite Madness table (DMG p. 260). |
### Variant Rule: The Lazy DM
This is a variant to the level 6 effect of Frenzied. Use this rule if your DM is feeling lazy or has enough on their plate already. (Do check with them to see if this is allowed). Replace the level 6 effect of Frenzied with the following:


| Level | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 6     | The madness has fully consumed you. You must roll a d20 on the start of each of your turns. On a 10 or lower, roll a d10 and consult the Confusion spell table for the action you must take. On a 1 you drop to 0 hp and die instantly. If you are revived you gain a character flaw from the Indefinite Madness table (DMG p. 260). |

## Ending the Condition
Frenzied levels can be removed with Greater Restoration or Divine Intervention
Resting in a calm and peaceful environment (such as a temple or serene location), undisturbed for 1d4 days removes 1 level of Frenzied.

A lesser restoration can stop Frenzied from getting worse for 24 hours, but cannot cure it.

Calm Emotions subdues the effects of Frenzied momentarily, but only if the creature has less than 4 Frenzied levels.

## Immunities
Creatures without sentience cannot get Frenzied. This includes Constructs, Plants and Most Undead (would not apply to liches for example).
