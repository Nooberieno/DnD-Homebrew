# Bleeding 
## Inflicting Bleeding
Some magical weapons or spells can inflict Bleeding. Bleeding can be applied multiple times to the same target, up to a maximum of 4 times. 1 "level" of Bleeding is referred to as a Bleeding Stack.

Current ways to inflict Bleed
- Spells:
	- [Furious Blade of Ansbach]({{site.baseurl}}/Tome%20of%20the%20Tarnished/Principa%20Incantare/#3-furious-blade-of-ansbach) (when fully charged)
- Infusions:
	- Blood Stone

## Effects of Bleeding
At the start of each turn the bleeding creature takes a d4 of damage for each for each Bleeding Stack it has(maximum of 4d4 damage) This damage has no type and cannot be reduced in any way. The bleeding creature has disadvantage on Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration. Bleeding creatures have disadvantage on saving throw to resist disease, as their open wound can easily be infected.

## Ending the Condition
Bleeding is ended when the target receives magical healing, to end this condition, a creature needs to receive 1 hp of magical healing per Bleeding Stack. Bleeding can also be ended by passing a Medicine Check with access to a healers kit or by spending an action to make a Constitution saving throw, the DC for both of these is equal to 13 + the amount of Bleeding Stacks you have. Additionally sufficient fire damage can cauterize the wound, stopping the bleeding. What counts as sufficient fire damage is up to the DM. 1 Bleeding Stack can be removed upon finishing a short rest. All Bleed Stacks are removed by finishing a long rest.

## Immunities
Creatures with no blood cannot bleed, this includes Undead, Constructs, Elementals, Spirits and Oozes. Certain Celestials, Fey, Plants, Aberrations and Fiends may also be immune to bleeding depending on their physiology.
