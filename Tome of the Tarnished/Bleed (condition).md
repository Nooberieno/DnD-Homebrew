# Bleed 
## Inflicting Bleed
Some magical weapons or spells can inflict Bleed. Bleed can be applied multiple times to the same target, up to a maximum of 4 times. 1 "level" of Bleed is referred to as a Bleed Stack.

Current ways to inflict Bleed
- Spells:
	- [Furious Blade of Ansbach]({{site.baseurl}}/Tome of the Tarnished/Principa Incantare/#3-furious-blade-of-ansbach) (when fully charged)
- Infusions:
	- Blood Stone

## Effects of Bleed
At the start of each turn the bleeding creature takes a d4 of damage for each for each Bleed Stack it has(maximum of 4d4 damage). The bleeding creature has disadvantage on Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration. Bleeding creatures have disadvantage on saving throw to resist disease, as their open wound can easily be infected.

## Ending the Condition
The bleed condition is ended when the target receives magical healing, to end this condition, a creature needs to receive 1 hp of magical healing per Bleed Stack. Bleed can also be ended by passing a Medicine Check with access to a healers kit or by spending an action to make a Constitution saving throw, the DC for both of these is equal to 13 + the amount of Bleed Stacks you have. Additionally sufficient fire damage can cauterize the wound, stopping the bleeding. What counts as sufficient fire damage is up to the DM. 1 Bleed Stack can be removed upon finishing a short rest. All Bleed Stacks are removed by finishing a long rest.

## Immunities
Creatures with no blood cannot bleed, this includes Undead, Constructs, Elementals, Spirits and Oozes. Certain Celestials, Fey, Plants, Aberrations and Fiends may also be immune to bleed depending on their physiology.

Jujutsu Sorcerers with the [Blood Manipulation]({{site.baseurl}}/Gojo's%20Guide%20to%20Cursing/subclasses/Cursed%20Techniques/Blood%20Manipulation) Cursed Technique are immune to this condition, due to them being able to manipulate their own blood.

Player Races immune to the Bleed Condition:
- Warforged (Construct)
- Plasmoid (Ooze)
- Genasi of any kind (Pseudo-Elementals)
