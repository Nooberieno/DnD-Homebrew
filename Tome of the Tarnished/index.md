Tome of the Tarnished is a compendium of arcane knowledge, containing spellbooks, mystical items, and forgotten lore. The original authors and creators of these artifacts have fallen from grace, their legacies tarnished by time and circumstance. Their works, however, endure as a testament to their once-great power and wisdom.
