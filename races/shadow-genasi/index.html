    Shadow Genasi
  </h1>
  <p><em>Genasi are an interesting race, some offspring of Genies and mortals, others influenced by a Genie's magic. Shadow Genasi represent everything Genies aren't allowed to do.</em>
Born of shadows and wishes, Shadow Genasi are the tragic offspring of desires fulfilled at a great cost. Devoid of elements, these Genasi are marked by their connection to Shadows and Secrecy, for the Genie who created them, does not want others to know they created life.  Most Shadow Genasi are shunned from society, fearing that accepting such magically created life would send the gods into a frenzy. This is why most Shadow Genasi eventually end up in the Shadowfell.</p>
<h2 id="appearance"><strong>Appearance</strong></h2>
<p>Shadow Genasi typically have ashen gray or jet-black skin that seems to shimmer faintly in dim light, as if shadows cling to their form. Their eyes are often pools of pure darkness or faintly glowing orbs, reminiscent of stars in the night sky. Their hair, if they have any, flows like ink or mist, and their presence often gives an eerie chill to those nearby.</p>
