<blockquote>
<p><em>Coleoids are stealthy and nimble, relying on their camouflage and ability to squeeze through tight spaces.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is theorized that Coleoid Cephalkin used to live in the same deep waters as other Cephalkin, but a fearsome predator forced them into hiding in cave system in shallower waters, although no one has been clear about what this predator could be. It is however a common explanation for Coleoid's more pronounced stealth and nimbleness. Coleoid Cephalkin have the weakest, yet most flexible tentacles and although their tentacles are weak, the suction cups on them are extremely well developed, allowing them to stick to most surfaces. Coleoids can be recognized by their signature pointy head shape, reminiscent of their distant squid cousins.</p>

</div><div class="subrace-features hidden" data-subclass="Nautiloid Cephalkin">
    <h4 id="nautiloid-cephalkin"><strong>Nautiloid Cephalkin</strong></h4>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Nautiloids have evolved a defensive shell, prioritizing durability over their agility on land.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many believers of the Coleoid predator theory, say that the Nautiloid's shell is another adaptation to defend from predators. These Cephalkin live at the lowest of depths and have the hardest time adjusting to land, finding that their shell slows them down when walking. Nautiloid Cephalkin often have many facial tentacles, which is often considered creepy by other humanoid races. Nautiloids are easily recognized by the spiral shell covering their heads, which contain and protect their brains. This means Nautiloids will die if their shell is removed. Their shell has made them quite the target for bandits and poachers, as armor created from a Nautiloid's shell lighter and more durable than any metal.</p>
