    Equinoid
  </h1>
  <p>The Equinoid race is one of the possible crossbreeds between a Minotaur and a Centaur. An Equinoid is distinguished by the beast like torso of the Minotaur and the horse like lower body from the Centaur. Female and male Equinoid tend to live alone, though not far away from others of their kind. They often mingle for festivals, trade or rituals. Only Equinoid couples stay together for long periods of time, for good reason.</p>
<h3 id="coupling">Coupling</h3>
<p>An Equinoid couple is formed through ritual, binding their fates. Should one member die or should the couple be separated for long periods of time, then the Equinoid are cursed. They are cursed with increasingly bad luck. It starts of mild, but as time goes on the intensity and severity increase. From food poisoning to lightning strikes, death lurks in every corner for a cursed Equinoid. No Equinoid has been known to survive</p>
<h2 id="traits">Traits</h2>
<h3 id="age">Age</h3>
<p>Equinoid lifespan are about 100 years long, owed to their Minotaurian lineage.</p>
<h3 id="alignment">Alignment</h3>
<p>Equinoid tend to be either LN, NG or N. They tend to be in tune with nature, and don’t cause harm without good reason. This does not mean they are fundamentally opposed to violence, it just is not a first resort.</p>
<h3 id="size">Size</h3>
<p>An Equinoid is usually around 7-9 ft tall and also typically has the same length as their height, so an Equinoid that is 8 ft tall should also be 8 ft long (this also means that the creature covers a 2x1 area on a standard grid). An Equinoid's height is measured horns to hooves, and its length is measured torso to tail. Your size is Medium</p>
<h3 id="speed">Speed</h3>
<p>Your base walking speed is 35 ft</p>
<h3 id="creature-type">Creature Type</h3>
<p>You are a fey</p>
<h3 id="languages">Languages</h3>
<p>You can speak, read and write Common and Taurian. Taurian is a language usually only spoken by horse like creature, such as Equinoids and Centaurs and other creatures could mistake it for the sounds of regular horses</p>
<h3 id="fight-or-flight">Fight or Flight</h3>
<p>When creating your character, choose a basic instinct: Fight or Flight. Both of these give an optional reaction you can use when getting attacked. These can be used a number of times equal half to your proficiency modifier.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fight: In your rage you can make a charge at your opponent using your powerful legs. This pushes the target back to 20 ft of your starting position, deals 1d6 piercing damage and an additional 2d6 bludgeoning damage if the enemy is knocked into a wall. Knocking an enemy into a wall makes them fall prone. You must be able to push the target to be able to charge at it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flight: You can use your reaction to make a dexterity saving throw of DC 18. On a successful throw, you roll out of the way and the attack misses your vital organs, thus dealing half damage.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ability-score-increase">Ability Score Increase</h3>
<p>Depending on your basic instinct, your ability scores increase. 
For fight, increase Strength by 2 and Constitution by 1. 
For flight, increase Dexterity by 2 and Strength by 1.</p>
<h3 id="beast-speech">Beast Speech </h3>
<p>Equinoid can communicate with horse like animals as if they shared a language, making it easier to befriend and understand wildlife.</p>
<h3 id="equine-build">Equine Build</h3>
<p>You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push or drag. In addition, any climb that requires hands and feet is especially difficult for you because of your equine legs. When you make such a climb, each foot of movement costs you 4 extra feet instead of the normal 1 extra foot. You can also be mounted other creatures of size medium or smaller.</p>
<h3 id="hooves">Hooves </h3>
<p>You have hooves that you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with them, the strike deals 1d6 + your Strength modifier bludgeoning damage, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.</p>
