<h3 id="second-wind">Second Wind</h3>
<p>You have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm. On your turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your fighter level.</p>
<p>Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>
<h3 id="action-surge">Action Surge</h3>
<p>Starting at 2nd level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your turn, you can take one additional action.</p>
<p>Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again. Starting at 17th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on the same turn.</p>
<h3 id="martial-archetype">Martial Archetype</h3>
<p>At 3rd level, you choose an archetype from the list available that you strive to emulate in your combat styles and techniques. The archetype you choose grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level.</p>
<div class="subclass-feature hidden" data-subclass="Heavenly Restricted Fighter">
    <h3 id="heavenly-restricted-fighter">Heavenly Restricted Fighter</h3>
<p>These fighters where born with bodies containing extreme strength, but as a trade-off their bodies are incapable of handling magic. Through training they can master their body, gaining exceptional strength, speed, and heightened senses, allowing them to surpass the limits of ordinary mortals.</p>
<h3 id="enhanced-physicality">Enhanced Physicality</h3>
<p><em>3th-level Heavenly Restricted Fighter feature</em></p>
<p>At 3rd level, you forgo all forms of magic and supernatural power in exchange for unparalleled physical attributes.</p>
<p><em>if you multiclass in this class and a spellcasting class, you can choose to reinvest your levels into a non spellcasting class, if you decide to keep your levels in a spellcasting class accepting this Martial Archetype means that if you try to cast a spell it <strong>will automatically fail</strong>. If your race grants spells or cantrips you lose access to them, instead you may increase your Strength, Constitution or Dexterity by 1 even above 20</em></p>
<p>You gain the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your carrying capacity doubles, and you can add your proficiency bonus to Strength checks and saving throws. Additionally, you have advantage on checks made to break objects.</li>
<li>Your base walking speed increases by 10 feet. You also gain the ability to dash as a bonus action.</li>
<li>You gain proficiency in the Perception and Stealth skills. If you are already proficient, you add double your proficiency bonus to Perception and Stealth checks.</li>
</ul>
<p>And the following detriments:</p>
<ul>
<li>You cannot cast magic and your body naturally resists any form of spellcasting. If a spell specifies that a unwilling target can resist, you always count as an unwilling target and have to resist, no matter the spell.</li>
<li>If you had proficiency in the Arcane skill you lose it and can gain proficiency in another Dexterity or Strength based skill of your choice that you did not have proficiency in. If you had proficiency in all Dexterity and Strength based skills, you gain nothing and just lose the Arcane proficiency.</li>
<li>You always have disadvantage when rolling Arcane skill checks and can never have a bonus in the Arcane skill, even if your stats would grant you bonuses.</li>
