<h2 id="class-features">Class Features</h2>
<h3 id="card-recovery">Card Recovery</h3>
<p>You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your Deck of Cards. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your cartomancer level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.</p>
<p>For example, if you're a 4th-level cartomancer, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.</p>
<h3 id="spellcasting">Spellcasting</h3>
<p>Your skill and prowess with cards and the arcane cards you posses are the source of your spells.</p>
<h4 id="cantrips">Cantrips</h4>
<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cartomancer spell list. You learn additional cartomancer cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the cartomancer table.</p>
<h4 id="spell-slots">Spell Slots</h4>
<p>The cartomancer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your cartomancer spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these cartomancer spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
<h4 id="spells-known-of-1st-level-or-higher">Spells Known of 1st level or higher</h4>
<p>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the cartomancer spell list.</p>
<p>You learn an additional cartomancer spell of your choice at each level except 12th, 14th, 16th, 18th, 19th, and 20th. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>
<p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the cartomancer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the cartomancer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
<h4 id="spellcasting-ability">Spellcasting ability</h4>
<p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your cartomancer spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cartomancer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
<p>  <strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + int + Proficiency Bonus</p>
<p>  <strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = int + Proficiency Bonus</p>
<h4 id="ritual-casting">Ritual Casting</h4>
<p>You can cast any cartomancer spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag</p>
<h3 id="deck-of-cards">Deck of Cards</h3>
<p>Choose your arcane deck of cards, which describe the deck you possess, from the list of available decks.</p>
<p>Your choice grants you features when you choose it at 1st level and again at 6th, 14th and 18th level.</p>
<p>Your deck of cards is the heart of your magic and is where you store your spells. Should this deck be destroyed you lose the ability to access all spells and features grant by your deck, except cantrips which are fixed in your mind.  If you can find a deck with the same symbols and number of cards, you can spend 1 hour to turn it your deck.</p>
<div class="subclass-feature hidden" data-subclass="Tarot Deck">
    <h3 id="tarot-deck">Tarot Deck</h3>
<p><em>"Each card carries a story, a secret, a truth waiting to be unveiled. Through the Tarot, you glimpse the weave of fate — and bend it to your will."</em></p>
<p>Tarot Deck Cartomancers are seers and fate-weavers, drawing power from prophecy and symbolism. Unlike the trickery of Jokers or the sharp odds of Poker, Tarot focuses on foresight, destiny, and manipulating probability in subtle but devastating ways.</p>
<p>This deck contains 78 cards: 56 Minor Arcana split evenly into 4 suits (Cups, Pentacles, Wands and Swords) and 22 Major Arcana</p>
<p><em>Note: If you have an actual Tarot Deck with 22 Major Arcana cards, you can draw a card from it for the Arcana's Whisper(Major) instead of rolling dice.</em></p>
<h3 id="deck-spells">Deck Spells</h3>
<p><em>1st-level Tarot Deck feature</em></p>
<p>Your deck infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th and 9th level you gain access to spells connected to your deck.</p>
<p>Once you gain access to a deck spell, you will always know it and it does not count against the number of spells you can know. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the cartomancer spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cartomancer spell for you.</p>

<p>Spells can only benefit from 1 Deck Action at a time.</p>
<ul>
<li>Overstock:</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Cost: 1 Deal</em></p>
<p>When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 Deal to reroll a number of damage dice equal to your Intelligence modifier. You must use the new rolls</p>
<ul>
<li>Magic Trick:</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Cost: 1 Deal</em></p>
<p>When you cast a spell, you can expend 1 Deal to cast it without verbal or somatic components</p>
<ul>
<li>Stack the Deck:</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Cost: 5 Deals</em></p>
<p>When you cast a spell that forces one or more creatures to make a saving throw, you can spend 5 Deals to force one creature that succeeded on its first saving throw against that spell to reroll it. The creature must use the new result.</p>
<ul>
<li>Discard:</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Cost: 2 Deals</em></p>
<p>When you make a spell attack roll for a spell and miss, you can spend 2 Deals to reroll the d20 and you must use the new roll.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lucky Card</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Cost: 1-2 Deals</em></p>
<p>When you make an ability check, you can spend 1 Deal to add a d4 to the result (after seeing the roll, but before knowing if it succeeds). You can spend 2 Deals instead to roll a d6 instead of a d4.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sticky Fingers</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Cost: 2 Deal</em></p>
<p>When you make a Sleight of Hand or Stealth check, you can spend 2 Deals to gain advantage.</p>

<p><em>Cost: 2 Deals</em></p>
<p>When you make a Charisma (Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion) check, you can spend 2 Deals to treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.</p>
<ul>
<li>Shuffle</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Cost: 1 Deal</em></p>
<p>When you cast a spell that deals a type of damage from the following list, you can spend 1 Deal to change that damage type to one of the other listed types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, thunder.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stock and Draw:</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Cost: 1-9 Deals</em></p>
<p>You can store a spell from the cartomancer spell list in a card by spending Deals equal to the spell’s level (1 Deal for a cantrip).<br />
The stored spell must have a casting time of 1 action.<br />
Only you can release the stored spell.<br />
To store it (Stock), you must be able to perform the spell's components.<br />
To release it (Draw), you must either touch the card or provide a verbal component while within 10 ft of the card.<br />
Once released, the spell behaves exactly as if it were just cast by you.<br />
While storing a spell in this way you cannot cast it normally without using Draw and only 1 spell can be stored this way at a time.<br />
Using Stock again causes the previous card to lose its magic.<br />
An unused spell fades from the card after a long rest.</p>
<p><strong>Deals</strong><br />
You have 3 Deals, and you gain one additional point every time you level up, to a maximum of 20 at level 20.<br />
You can never have more Deals than shown on the table for your level.<br />
You regain all spent Deals when you finish a long rest.</p>

The message may be cryptic or clear, literal or metaphorical, at the DM’s discretion. You do not know exactly <strong>when</strong> or <strong>how</strong> the vision will come to pass — only that it is tied to events in the near future.</p>
<ul>
