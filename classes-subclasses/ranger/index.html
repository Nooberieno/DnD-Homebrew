<h3 id="favored-enemy">Favored Enemy</h3>
<p>Beginning at 1st level, you have significant experience studying, tracking, hunting, and even talking to a certain type of enemy.</p>
<p>Choose a type of favored enemy: <a href="https://2014.5e.tools/bestiary.html#blankhash,flsttype:aberration=1">aberrations</a>, <a href="https://2014.5e.tools/bestiary.html#blankhash,flsttype:beast=1">beasts</a>, <a href="https://2014.5e.tools/bestiary.html#blankhash,flsttype:celestial=1">celestials</a>, <a href="https://2014.5e.tools/bestiary.html#blankhash,flsttype:construct=1">constructs</a>, <a href="https://2014.5e.tools/bestiary.html#blankhash,flsttype:dragon=1">dragons</a>, <a href="https://2014.5e.tools/bestiary.html#blankhash,flsttype:elemental=1">elementals</a>, <a href="https://2014.5e.tools/bestiary.html#blankhash,flsttype:fey=1">fey</a>, <a href="https://2014.5e.tools/bestiary.html#blankhash,flsttype:fiend=1">fiends</a>, <a href="https://2014.5e.tools/bestiary.html#blankhash,flsttype:giant=1">giants</a>, <a href="https://2014.5e.tools/bestiary.html#blankhash,flsttype:monstrosity=1">monstrosities</a>, <a href="https://2014.5e.tools/bestiary.html#blankhash,flsttype:ooze=1">oozes</a>, <a href="https://2014.5e.tools/bestiary.html#blankhash,flsttype:plant=1">plants</a>, or <a href="https://2014.5e.tools/bestiary.html#blankhash,flsttype:undead=1">undead</a>. Alternatively, you can select two races of <a href="https://2014.5e.tools/bestiary.html#blankhash,flsttype:humanoid=1">humanoid</a> (such as gnoll and orc) as favored enemies.</p>
<p>You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them.</p>
<p>When you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice that is spoken by your favored enemies, if they speak one at all.</p>
<p>You choose one additional favored enemy, as well as an associated language, at 6th and 14th level. As you gain levels, your choices should reflect the types of monsters you have encountered on your adventures.</p>
<h3 id="favored-foe">Favored Foe</h3>
<p><em>1st-level ranger <a href="https://2014.5e.tools/variantrules.html#optional%20class%20features_tce">optional feature</a>, which replaces the Favored Enemy feature and works with the Foe Slayer feature</em></p>
<p>When you hit a creature with an attack roll, you can call on your mystical bond with nature to mark the target as your favored enemy for 1 minute or until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentration on a spell).</p>
<p>The first time on each of your turns that you hit the favored enemy and deal damage to it, including when you mark it, you can increase that damage by 1d4.</p>
<p>You can use this feature to mark a favored enemy a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
<p>This feature's extra damage increases when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d6 at 6th level and to 1d8 at 14th level.</p>
<h3 id="natural-explorer">Natural Explorer</h3>
<p>You are particularly familiar with one type of natural environment and are adept at traveling and surviving in such regions. Choose one type of favored terrain: arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp, or the Underdark. When you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check related to your favored terrain, your proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using a skill that you're proficient in.</p>
<p>While traveling for an hour or more in your favored terrain, you gain the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Difficult terrain doesn't slow your group's travel.</li>
<li>Your group can't become lost except by magical means.</li>
<li>Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.</li>
<li>If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.</li>
<li>When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would.</li>
<li>While tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area.</li>
</ul>
<p>You choose additional favored terrain types at 6th and 10th level.</p>
<h3 id="deft-explorer">Deft Explorer</h3>
<p><em>1st-level ranger <a href="https://2014.5e.tools/variantrules.html#optional%20class%20features_tce">optional feature</a>, which replaces the Natural Explorer feature</em></p>
<p>You are an unsurpassed explorer and survivor, both in the wilderness and in dealing with others on your travels. You gain the Canny benefit below, and you gain an additional benefit below when you reach 6th level and 10th level in this class.</p>
<h4 id="canny">Canny</h4>
<p>Choose one of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses the chosen skill.</p>
<p>You can also speak, read, and write two additional languages of your choice.</p>
<h3 id="fighting-style">Fighting Style</h3>
<p>At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://2014.5e.tools/optionalfeatures.html#archery_phb">Archery</a></li>

<li><a href="https://2014.5e.tools/optionalfeatures.html#thrown weapon fighting_tce">Thrown Weapon Fighting</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="spellcasting">Spellcasting</h3>
<p>By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the <a href="https://2014.5e.tools/spells.html#blankhash,flstclass:ranger=1">ranger spell list</a>.</p>
<h4 id="spell-slots">Spell Slots</h4>
<p>The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your <a href="https://2014.5e.tools/spells.html#blankhash,flstclass:ranger=1">ranger spells</a> of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
<p>For example, if you know the 1st-level spell animal friendship and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast animal friendship using either slot.</p>
<h4 id="spells-known-of-1st-level-and-higher">Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h4>
<p>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list.</p>
<p>The Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>
<p>Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
<h4 id="spellcasting-ability">Spellcasting Ability</h4>
<p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
<p>  <strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + wis + Proficiency Bonus</p>
<p>  <strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = wis + Proficiency Bonus</p>
<h3 id="spellcasting-focus">Spellcasting Focus</h3>
<p><em>2nd-level ranger <a href="https://2014.5e.tools/variantrules.html#optional%20class%20features_tce">optional feature</a></em></p>
<p>You can use a <a href="https://2014.5e.tools/items.html#druidic focus_phb">druidic focus</a> as a spellcasting focus for your ranger spells. A druidic focus might be a sprig of mistletoe or holly, a wand or rod made of yew or another special wood, a staff drawn whole from a living tree, or an object incorporating feathers, fur, bones, and teeth from sacred animals.</p>
<h3 id="ranger-archetype">Ranger Archetype</h3>
<p>At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate from the list of available archetypes. Your choice grants features at 3rd level, and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level.</p>
<div class="subclass-feature hidden" data-subclass="Nightstalker - Shadow Shot Variant">
    <h3 id="nightstalker-shadow-shot-variant">Nightstalker - Shadow Shot Variant</h3>
<p><em>Masters of the shadows and misdirection</em></p>
<h3 id="shadow-infusion">Shadow Infusion</h3>
<p><em>3th-level Nightstalker - Shadow Shot Variant feature</em></p>
<p>You gain the ability to channel shadowy energy to bind and hinder your foes. You learn the following techniques:</p>
<p><strong>Shadow Snare</strong>:</p>
<p>As a bonus action, you can fire a shadowy tether at a creature within 60 ft. The target must make a Dexterity Saving throw. On a failed save, the target is restrained by shadowy tendrils till the end of its next turn.</p>
<p><strong>Shade Step</strong>:</p>
<p>You step into the shadows, getting out of sight from enemies. You gain the same benefits as using the Hide action</p>
<p>You may use these abilities an amount of times equal to your proficiency modifier, regaining all uses upon finishing a long rest.</p>
