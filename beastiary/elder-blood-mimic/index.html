    Elder Blood Mimic
  </h1>
  <p class="subtitle"><strong></strong></p>
  <p><em>As if regular Mimics weren't enough already</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Elder Blood Mimics are apex predators among their kind, ancient aberrations born from the confluence of mimic evolution and dark, otherworldly energies. Unlike their smaller kin, which rely mostly on ambush tactics and mimicry of objects, Elder Blood Mimics, like regular Blood Mimics possess to ability to copy creatures. What really sets Elder Blood Mimics apart is a special Core that functions as their heart and along with extreme intelligence and reasoning ability gives them the terrifying ability to dominate and control entire colonies of mimics and blood mimics alike. Their presence warps the environment around them, transforming once-thriving settlements into twisted nightmares where every object could be a predator.
These creatures are exceedingly rare, with only a handful known to exist across the planes. Each Elder Blood Mimic is unique, shaped by the environment it has dominated and the prey it has consumed. They are highly intelligent, capable of complex strategies and manipulation, often creating symbiotic relations with humanoid civilizations to ensure a steady food supply.
Elder Blood Mimics are driven by an insatiable hunger, not just for flesh or power. They seek to expand their influence, often corrupting or consuming anything that threatens their dominion. Killing an Elder Blood Mimic is no small feat. Their hive mind ensures that even in death, their influence can linger, requiring the destruction of their core to sever their connection to their kin</p>

<h3 id="traits">Traits</h3>
<p><em><strong>Amorphous.</strong></em> The Elder Blood Mimic can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.<br />
<em><strong>Legendary Resistance (3/Day).</strong></em> If the Elder Blood Mimic fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.<br />
<em><strong>Hive Mind.</strong></em> All mimics within 1 mile of the Elder Blood Mimic are telepathically connected to it and act as extensions of its will. While the Elder Blood Mimic lives, all mimics within this radius have advantage on attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks.<br />
<em><strong>Mimicry Overload.</strong></em> The Elder Blood Mimic can use an action to command all mimics within its lair to shapeshift simultaneously, creating chaos and confusion. Each creature within 60 feet of a mimic must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute.</p>
<h3 id="actions">Actions</h3>
<p><em><strong>Multiattack.</strong></em> The Elder Blood Mimic makes three attacks: one with its pseudopod and two with its Bite.<br />
<em><strong>Pseudopod.</strong></em> Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (3d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 18). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained.<br />
<em><strong>Bite.</strong></em> Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 22 (4d8 + 6) piercing damage. If the target is grappled by the Elder Blood Mimic, the bite deals an additional 14 (4d6) acid damage.<br />
<em><strong>Feast of the Abyss (Recharge 5-6).</strong></em> The Elder Blood Mimic chooses a spot it can see within 60 ft. All creatures within a 15 ft radius must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 6d8 necrotic damage, and the Elder Blood Mimic regains hit points equal to half the damage dealt. On a successful save, the target takes half damage, and the Elder Blood Mimic regains no hit points.</p>
<h3 id="reactions">Reactions</h3>
<p><em><strong>Symbiotic Resilience.</strong></em> 3 times per long rest, when the Elder Blood Mimic takes damage, it can roll a d6. On a roll of 5 or higher, it forces nearby mimics to take the damage for it, taking no damage instead.<br />
<em><strong>Dark Predation.</strong></em> Twice per long rest, the Elder Blood Mimic can use Feast of the Abyss on a nearby mimic, killing it and regaining all hit points automatically.</p>
<h3 id="lair-actions">Lair Actions</h3>
<p><em><strong>Collapse Structure.</strong></em> The Elder Blood Mimic causes a nearby building or structure to collapse. Each creature within a 20-foot radius of the building must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) bludgeoning damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one. The area becomes difficult terrain.<br />
<em><strong>Rising Walls.</strong></em> The mimic-controlled city shifts, causing walls of stone and wood to erupt from the ground. The Elder Blood Mimic creates a 30-foot-long, 10-foot-high wall anywhere within its lair. The wall provides total cover and lasts until the mimic uses this lair action again or dies.<br />
<em><strong>Urban Distortion.</strong></em> The streets twist and buckle under the mimicâ€™s control. Each creature within 60 feet of the Elder Blood Mimic must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone as the ground shifts violently.<br />
<em><strong>Warping Streets.</strong></em> The mimics rearrange the cityscape by moving all streets. Each creature within the city must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be moved up to 20 feet away from the Elder Blood Mimic.</p>
<h3 id="legendary-actions">Legendary Actions</h3>
<p><em><strong>Pseudopod Attack.</strong></em> The Elder Blood Mimic makes one pseudopod attack.<br />
<em><strong>Swallow Whole (Costs 2 Actions).</strong></em> The Elder Blood Mimic targets one creature it is grappling. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed. A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, has total cover from attacks, and takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the Elder Blood Mimicâ€™s turns.<br />
<em><strong>Lair Command (Costs 3 Actions).</strong></em> The Elder Blood Mimic uses one of its lair actions.</p>
