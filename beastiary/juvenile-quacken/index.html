<h3 id="traits">Traits</h3>
<p><em><strong>Amphibious.</strong></em> The Quacken can breathe air and water.<br />
<em><strong>Legendary Resistance (3/Day).</strong></em> If the Quacken fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.<br />
<em><strong>Siege Monster.</strong></em> The Quacken deals double damage to objects and structures.<br />
<em><strong>Tentaclaws.</strong></em> The Quacken has six <a href="https://nooberieno.github.io/DnD-Homebrew/beastiary/juvenile-quacken-tentaclaw/">tentaclaws</a>. A Quacken’s tentaclaw has its own stat block, but shares the Quacken’s senses and can’t act independently from the Quacken. The Quacken commands and moves its tentaclaws on its turn, according to its Multi-attack action. A tentaclaw can’t be more than 30 feet away from the Quacken, and if the Quacken moving would result in a tentaclaw being beyond this range, the tentaclaw moves with the Quacken. If a Quacken’s tentaclaw is reduced to 0 hit points, it separates from the Quacken and goes inert. If the Quacken is reduced to 0 hit points, all its tentaclaws are reduced to 0 hit points as well. The Quacken regrows all lost tentaclaws when it finishes a long rest.</p>
<h3 id="actions">Actions</h3>
<p><em><strong>Multi-attack.</strong></em> The Quacken has up to three of its tentaclaws each move up to its speed and make a single Slam attack or Fling each. It can replace one of these tentaclaw actions with a use of its Maw instead.<br />
<em><strong>Maw.</strong></em> Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 2d8 + 4 piercing damage. Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained. If the target is a Large or smaller creature grappled by the Quacken, that creature is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the Quacken, and it takes 8d6 acid damage at the start of each of the Quacken's turns. If the Quacken takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the Quacken must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the Quacken. If the Quacken dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone.<br />
<em><strong>Typhoon (Recharge 5-6).</strong></em> The Quacken flaps its wings, creating a column of wind and lightning in a 5-foot-radius, 30-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within 30 feet of it. Each creature within 10 feet of the cylinder must make a DC 17 Strength saving throw. This saving throw is made with disadvantage if a creature is within the space of the cylinder. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage, plus 3d6 cold damage, plus 3d6 lightning damage, is pulled to the top of the cylinder, and then thrown 30 feet horizontally in a random direction. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t moved.</p>
<h3 id="bonus-actions">Bonus Actions</h3>
<p><em><strong>Regenerate.</strong></em> If the Quacken has fewer than six tentaclaws, it can choose to take 75 necrotic damage, which can’t be reduced or prevented in any way. A new tentaclaw then grows from its body, appearing with 75 hit points in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the Quacken.</p>
<h3 id="reactions">Reactions</h3>
<p><em><strong>Off a Duck’s Back.</strong></em> When the Quacken takes damage, it can choose to roll a d6. On a roll of 5 or higher, the Quacken takes no damage instead.</p>
<h3 id="legendary-actions">Legendary Actions</h3>
<p><em><strong>Tentaclaw.</strong></em> The Quacken has one of its tentaclaws move up to its speed and make a Slam attack or use its Fling.<br />
<em><strong>Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).</strong></em> The Quacken beats its wings. Each creature within 10 feet of the Quacken must succeed on a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw or take 17 (2d6 + 10) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The Quacken can then fly or swim up to half its flying or swimming speed.<br />
<em><strong>Tentaclaw Snapback (Costs 3 Actions).</strong></em> Each of the Quacken’s tentaclaws moves up to 40 feet in a straight line towards the Quacken, moving through other creatures’ spaces as it does so. When a tentaclaw moves into a creature’s space, that creature must make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d6 + 10 bludgeoning damage and is pulled by the tentaclaw to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the Quacken. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and moves to an unoccupied space of its choice within 5 feet of the tentaclaw.</p>
