These Sorcerers inherent magic comes from the [Jujutsu](/Gojo's%20Guide%20to%20Cursing/subclasses/Cursed%20Techniques/) etched into their very flesh. Some religions and beliefs consider children born with this kind of magic as Cursed and an Omen of Doom. This is why Jujutsu is more often referred to as a [Cursed Technique](/Gojo's%20Guide%20to%20Cursing/subclasses/Cursed%20Techniques/). Jujutsu usually requires hand seals and incantations and only true masters of their techniques can omit these.

### Level 1: Resistance of the Accursed
At 1st level you gain resistance to necrotic damage, if you already have resistance you gain immunity.

### Level 3: Cursed Technique
At 3rd level you learn to draw on the latent power of your Cursed Technique. Choose which [Cursed Technique](/Gojo's%20Guide%20to%20Cursing/subclasses/Cursed%20Techniques/) you would like to have and keep track of it as it will also reward features at certain level milestones.

### level 6: Reverse Cursed Technique
Starting at 6th level you learn how to reverse your reverse your technique to heal instead of harm. As a bonus action, you can heal yourself for an amount equal to 1d6 + your sorcerer level + your charisma modifier. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Level 10: Resilience of the Obscene
When you reach 10th level, when you take damage, you can use your reaction to gain resistance to that instance of damage. You can use this feature an amount of times equal to your proficiency modifier. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

- Omit both the Verbal and Semantic components of a spell
