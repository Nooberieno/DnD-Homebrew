These fighters where born with bodies containing extreme strength, but as a trade-off their bodies are incapable of handling magic. Through training they can master their body, gaining exceptional strength, speed, and heightened senses, allowing them to surpass the limits of ordinary mortals.

#### Level 3: Enhanced Physicality

At 3rd level, you forgo all forms of magic and supernatural power in exchange for unparalleled physical attributes. 

_if you multiclass in this class and a spellcasting class, you can choose to reinvest your levels into a non spellcasting class, if you decide to keep your levels in a spellcasting class accepting this Martial Archetype means that if you try to cast a spell it **will automatically fail**. Warlocks and Clerics communication with their patron or deity will become hazy. If your race grants spells or cantrips you lose access to them, instead you may increase your Strength, Constitution or Dexterity by 1 even above 20_

You gain the following benefits:

- **Heavenly Strength**: Your carrying capacity doubles, and you can add your proficiency bonus to Strength checks and saving throws. Additionally, you have advantage on checks made to break objects.
    
- **Blinding Speed**: Your base walking speed increases by 10 feet. You also gain the ability to dash as a bonus action.
    
- **Heightened Senses**: You gain proficiency in the Perception and Stealth skills. If you are already proficient, you add double your proficiency bonus to Perception and Stealth checks.
    

And the following detriments:

- **Squib**: You cannot cast magic and your body naturally resists any form of spellcasting. If a spell specifies that a unwilling target can resist, you always qualify as an unwilling target, no matter the spell.

- **Arcane Nitwit**: If you had proficiency in the Arcane skill you lose it and can gain proficiency in another Dex or Strength based skill of your choice that you did not have proficiency in. If you had proficiency in all Dex and Strength based skills, you gain nothing and just lose the Arcane proficiency. 

- **Murphy's Law**: You always have disadvantage when rolling an Arcane skill check and can never have a bonus higher than +3 in the Arcane Skill, if your stats would grant you higher bonuses, you may only add +3 to the roll

#### Level 7: Unyielding Body

By 7th level, your physical training allows you to withstand incredible punishment and perform superhuman feats.

- **Sturdy Frame**: You gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from non-magical attacks.
    
- **Powerful Strikes**: When you make an unarmed strike, you can choose to deal 1d6 + your Strength modifier in damage, or 1d8 + your Strength modifier if you are wielding no weapons and not wearing armor.
    
- **Iron Stamina**: You can use your bonus action to gain temporary hit points equal to your Fighter level. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
    

#### Level 10: Perceptive Reflexes

Starting at 10th level, your heightened perception and reflexes make you a formidable opponent in battle.

- **Combat Awareness**: You can't be surprised, and attack rolls against you can't have advantage as long as you aren't incapacitated.
    
- **Quick Reactions**: When a creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to make a single melee weapon attack against that creature.
    
- **Eagle Eyes**: You can see in dim light as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light, up to a range of 60 feet. Additionally, you have advantage on Perception checks that rely on sight.
    

#### Level 15: Supreme Physicality

At 15th level, your physical abilities reach their peak, allowing you to perform feats that defy common understanding.

- **Unstoppable Force**: You can use your action to make a single attack that ignores resistance and immunity to non-magical damage. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Strength modifier (minimum of 1), and regain all uses after a long rest.
    
- **Lightning Reflexes**: You gain a +2 bonus to your Dexterity saving throws and initiative rolls.
    
- **Inhuman Endurance**: When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
    

#### Level 18: Limitless Potential

At 18th level, you unlock the full potential of your physical abilities, transcending the boundaries of human limitation.

- **Master of the Body**: You gain a +2 bonus to your Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores. This bonus can increase your ability scores above 20, but not above 25.
    
- **Blitz Strike**: Once per turn, when you take the Attack action, you can make one additional melee weapon attack as part of that action.
    
- **Ultimate Defense**: When you take damage, you can use your reaction to halve the damage taken. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1), and regain all uses after a long rest.
