_**Requirement**: Users race must be capable of bleeding._   

Some creatures are just born with cursed blood in their veins. These [Jujutsu Sorcerers]({{site.baseurl}}/Gojo's%20Guide%20to%20Cursing/subclasses/Jujutsu%20Sorcerer) have an innate ability to control their cursed blood through this [Cursed Technique]({{site.baseurl}}/Gojo's%20Guide%20to%20Cursing/subclasses/Cursed%20Techniques/). 

### Level 3: Blood Manipulation

- **Red Flowing Scale**: As a bonus action, you can enhance your physical abilities. For 1 minute you gain +2 to attack and damage rolls and your movement increases by 10 ft
- **Blood Edge**: You can use your bonus action to create a melee weapon made of your blood. You can choose the form of this weapon. This weapon uses your Charisma modifier for attack and damage rolls. This weapon deals an additional 1d6 poison damage. The weapon disappears when you want it to, when it leaves your hand or after 2 hours. If you have proficiency in the type of weapon you form you may add your proficiency modifier to your attack role. This weapons damage counts as magical for the sake of overcoming immunities or resistances.

### Level 3: Blood Poisoning
