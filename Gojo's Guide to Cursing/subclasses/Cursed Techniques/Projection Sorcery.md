# Projection Sorcery
This technique divides one second into twenty-four frames of animation using the user's field of view as the projection angle of view. The user can trace a predetermined set of movements into those twenty-four frames and execute them in that single second. Moving using this technique makes the user appear to move unnaturally fast.

### Level 3: Frameshift
Frameshift enhances your reflexes and speed, allowing you to act faster than your enemies. You gain the following benefits:

- **Blinding Speed:** Your movement speed increases by 10 feet.
- **Quick Reflexes:** Add your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1) to initiative rolls.
- **Hyper-Awareness:** Opportunity attacks against you are made with disadvantage.

### Level 5: Freeze Frame
You gain **Freeze Frame** as a unique spell. It can be cast using a spell slot or by expending 2 sorcery points.

**Freeze Frame**  
_1st level Enchantment_  
**Casting Time:** 1 action  
**Range:** Touch  
**Components**: S  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute or until the start of your next turn (whichever comes first).  

**Description**  
 Choose one creature you touch. If its initiative is lower than 24 or your current initiative (whichever is higher), it is affected by Freeze Frame. While affected:  
- Its movement speed is halved.  
- It cannot take reactions.  
- The target has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws

Hitting a creature while its affected by **Freeze Frame** ends the duration of this spell and the target takes an additional 1d10 force damage

### Level 8: Precision Blitz
You exploit slowed foes with rapid, precise strikes. When you take the Attack action or cast a spell targeting a creature affected by Freeze Frame, you can make one additional weapon attack or cast a cantrip as part of the same action.

### Level 15: Recursive Freeze
You can sustain multiple Freeze Frame effects and enhance their potency.

- When casting Freeze Frame, expend an additional spell slot of 1st level or higher to target an additional creatures that you can touch, (When expending a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, target an additional creature for each slot level above 1st.) failing a concentration check while multiple targets are affected ends the duration on all affected targets. Hitting them 
- Enemies affected by Freeze Frame must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier) at the start of their turn. On a failure, they are stunned until the end of their turn.
- For each creature unaffected by Freeze Frame due to high initiative or a successful saving throw, the initiative threshold to affect them increases by 2 (e.g., from 24 to 26).

### Level 17: _Domain Expansion: Time Cell Moon Palace_
Your ultimate mastery of Projection Sorcery lets you trap creatures in a frame by frame reality. This feature replaces your 9th level spell.

_9th level Evocation_  
**Casting Time**: 1 action  
**Range**: Self(120 ft radius)  
**Components**: V, S  
**Duration**: Concentration, up to 1 minute  

**Description**  
With yourself at the center you trap all creatures in a frame by frame reality, granting the following benefits:
- When a creature takes any action that requires moving, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC of your initiative or your spell save DC, whichever is higher) or be affected by freeze frame, unless you choose to exclude the creature.
- You gain +10 ft of movement speed and an additional action you that if you use you must use it to either:
  - Make a melee attack
  - cast a cantrip
  - cast a leveled spell(if you have not cast a leveled spell on your turn already)
- All spells you cast while the domain is active deal maximum damage. if the spell's damage scales with level it does the max damage for the spell slot level you used to cast it.
- No creature can exit the radius enveloped by your domain, but other creatures can enter freely
- Your domain counts as full cover if a creature tries to target you from outside the domain's range.

_Note_: all domain expansions can be ended by making the caster drop concentration, succeeding with counterspell, casting antimagic field with the caster in range or potentially by casting your own domain expansion. If you cast domain expansion to end another domain, both of the casters roll a d20, whoever rolls highest is whose domain stays.
