Limitless is [[Cursed Technique]] for the [[Jujutsu Sorcerer]]. This technique brings the concept of "**Infinity**" into reality, allowing the user to manipulate and distort space at will.
### Level 3: Infinity
Infinity is the base state of limitless and allows the user to distort the space around them to ward off spells and attacks. You can spend 1 Sorcery points to gain the following effect:
* When you are targeted by a spell that requires a melee attack roll or requires the caster to touch you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll or force the caster to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the spell fails to affect you.
* When a spell targets you and has a range that requires it to be within a certain distance (e.g., 30 feet), the caster must increase the range by an additional 25 ft to successfully target you. If the caster cannot meet this range requirement, the spell fails to affect you. _Example_: if an enemy wants to hit you with Eldritch Blast and you are 100 ft away, you can use infinity so that you are now out of the effective range of the spell, as 100+25=125 and that is higher than the maximum range of Eldritch Blast(120 ft). If the enemy moves so that you are now only 95 ft away, well 95+25=120, which is in range of the spell so you would inside the effective range
### Level 5: Amplification: Blue
You learn to amplify your control over space to create an orb that attracts things. You learn the Amplification: Blue spell. This does not count towards the amount of spells you know.

_3rd level Evocation_  
**Casting Time**: 1 action  
**Range**: 60 ft (20 ft radius)  
**Components**: V, S  
**Duration**: 2 turns  

**Description**
Choose a point you can see within 60 feet. All creatures and objects within a 20-foot radius of that point must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, they take 2d6 force damage and are pulled 15 feet towards the center of the point. On a successful save, they take half damage and are not pulled. If a creature starts its turn in the radius it has to make the save again, taking 1d6 force damage and getting pulled 5 ft to the center of the point. A successful save results in no additional damage and no pull.

### Level 8: Reversal: Red
Applying reversed cursed technique to Blue gives you Red, a slightly more powerful orb that repels things. This does not count towards the amount of spells you know.

_4th level Evocation_  
**Casting Time**: 1 action  
**Range**: 60 ft (20 ft radius)  
**Components**: V, S  
**Duration**: 2 turns  

**Description**
Choose a point you can see within 60 feet. All creatures and objects within a 20-foot radius of that point must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, they take 2d8 force damage and are pushed 20 feet away from the center of the point. On a successful save, they take half damage and are not pushed. If a creature starts its turn in the radius it has to make the save again, taking 1d6 force damage and getting pushed 5 ft away from the center of the point on a failed save. A successful save results in no additional damage and no push  

### Level 15: Hollow Purple
Combining both Blue and Red gives you Purple, this devastating orb both pushes and pulls things, ripping them apart in the process. This does not count towards the amount of spells you know.

_7th level Evocation_  
**Casting**: 1 action  
**Range**: 120 ft (30 ft)  
**Components**: V, S  
**Duration**: Instantaneous  

**Description**
Choose a point you can see within 120 feet. All creatures within a 30-foot radius of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 8d8 force damage, is pulled 15 feet towards the center of the point, and then pushed 15 feet away from the point. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and is not pulled or pushed. 

_Note_: When casting Blue and Red with the same center point, you can spend 6 Sorcery Points to combine them into Hollow Purple.

### Level 17: _Domain Expansion: Infinite Void_
You learn the ins and outs of your technique and can inscribe it into space itself. This acts as your 9th level spell. Once your domain ends you may not use any of your technique features untill you complete a long or short rest.

_9th level Evocation_  
**Casting Time**: 1 action  
**Range**: Self(30 ft radius)  
**Components**: V, S  
**Duration**: up to 6 rounds  

**Description**
You lay out your cursed technique into the world around being infinity forth into the world. Overflowing the target's senses with infinite information. Your domain is an area of effect that does the following. 
- If the creature is 5 ft inside the radius when the domain is cast it must make a Dexterity saving throw, if it succeeds it moves outside the radius of your domain expansion.
- Every time a creature starts its turn inside the domain expansion it must make a Wisdom saving throw of DC 20 or your spell save DC(whichever is higher). If it fails the creature is considered stunned for the duration of the domain expansion + 5 turns, if this spell ends, it may make the Saving throw again at the start of each of its turns, if it succeeds its no longer stunned. If it succeeds the Wisdom saving throw instead it gains 1 level of exhaustion.
- At the start of each turn a creature inside your domain takes 2d6 psychic damage.
- Your domain counts as full cover

_Note_: all domain expansion can be ended by killing the caster, succeeding with counterspell, casting antimagic field with the caster in range or potentially by casting your own domain expansion. If you cast domain expansion to end another both of the casters roll a d20, whoever rolls highest is whose domain wins.
