#### **1. Idle Transfiguration**:
*3rd level Transmutation*
**Casting Time**: 1 action
**Range**: Touch
**Components**: S
**Duration**: Instantaneous
**Classes**: Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

**Description**
You reach out and touch a target creature of Large, Medium or Small size, attempting to alter or disfigure their soul and thus their body. The target must succeed on a Constitution Check of DC 6 + spellcasting modifier + proficiency or take 4d8 necrotic damage, taking half as much on a successful save. If the target is humanoid, is reduced to 6% HP or less by this spell and fails the save, they are transmuted into a [Transfigured Humanoid](/Gojo's%20Guide%20to%20Cursing/creatures/Transfigured%20Humanoid) which you may command.

_At Higher Levels_: When this spell is cast using a spell slot of 4th or higher the DC increases by 1. For every 2 levels(5th, 7th and 9th level), the HP requirement for making the target a Transfigured Humanoid increases by 2%
