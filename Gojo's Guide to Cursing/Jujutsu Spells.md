#### **1. Idle Transfiguration**:
*3rd level Transmutation*  
**Casting Time**: 1 action  
**Range**: Touch  
**Components**: V, S  
**Duration**: Instantaneous  
**Classes**: Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard  

**Description**  
You reach out and touch a target creature of Large, Medium or Small size, attempting to alter or disfigure their soul and thus their body. The target must succeed on a Constitution Saving throw of DC 6 + spellcasting modifier + proficiency or take 4d8 necrotic damage, taking half as much on a successful save. If the target is under 6% HP and fails the save, they are transmuted into a [Transfigured Humanoid]({{site.baseurl}}/Gojo's%20Guide%20To%20Cursing/creatures/Transfigured%20Humanoid/) which you may command.

_At Higher Levels_: When this spell is cast using a spell slot of 4th or higher the DC increases by 1. For every 2 levels(5th, 7th and 9th level), the HP requirement for making the target a Transfigured Human increases by 2%

#### **2. Boogie Woogie**:  
*5th level Conjuration*  
**Casting Time**: 1 action  
**Range**: 60 ft  
**Components**: S(a clap from the soul)  
**Duration**: Instantaneous  
**Classes**: Sorcerer, Wizard  

**Description**  
You clap your hands together, which swaps to objects in space. Choose two targets you can see within range. These targets can be creatures, objects, or a combination of both. If the chosen targets are willing, they instantly switch places. Unwilling targets must make a Charisma saving throw to resist the effect. On a successful save, the spell has no effect on that target.

_At Higher Levels_: When casting with a 6th level spell slot or higher you gain 10 ft of range for every level above 5th

#### **3. Cursed Speech**  
_8th Level Transmutation_  
**Casting Time**: 1 action  
**Range**: 175 ft  
**Components**: V  
**Duration**: Instantaneous  
**Classes**: Cleric, Sorcerer, Wizard  

**Description**  
By speaking out loud you force creatures to obey your very desires. The most common use of this spell is to get enemies to follow basic commands. For example: Choose up to three creatures within range that can hear you. The creatures do not need to share a language with you and a creature will obey even directly harmful attacks, if the spell lands. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by one of the following commands (your choice):

- **"Stop"**: The creature is paralyzed until the end of its next turn.
- **"Flee"**: The creature must use its movement to move away from you by the safest available route on each of its turns until it is at least 60 feet away from you.
- **"Attack"**: The creature must use its action to attack a creature of your choice within its range.
- **"Sleep"**: The creature falls unconscious until the end of its next turn. It awakens if it takes damage or someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake.

You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your command to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the more powerful the command, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the command, or the command will backfire dealing psychic damage to you.

_At Higher Levels_: if you use a 9th level spell slot to cast this spell the duration of the effects of basic commands increases by two turns (a creature now sleeps 3 rounds until waking up at the end of the 3rd round) or if you use a more daring command the likelihood of succeeding will increase.

#### **4. Heart Catch**  
_4th Level Evocation_  
**Casting Time**: 1 action  
**Range**: 60 ft  
**Components**: S  
**Duration**: Concentration, Up to 1 minute  
**Classes**: Sorcerer, Wizard, Arcane Trickster  

**Description**  
You create a floating, spectral hand that can grab and manipulate a creature at a distance. Choose a creature within range. The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained by the spectral hand. While restrained, you can use your action on subsequent turns to perform one of the following actions:

- **Throw**: You can throw the restrained creature up to 30 feet in any direction, dealing 3d8 bludgeoning damage if it collides with a solid surface or another creature. The thrown creature and any creature it collides with must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.
- **Crush**: You can crush the restrained creature, dealing 4d8 force damage. The creature remains restrained as long as you concentrate on the spell, up to the duration.


The restrained creature can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, the creature frees itself and the spell ends.
