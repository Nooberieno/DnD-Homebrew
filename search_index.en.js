Unlike their smaller kin, which rely mostly on ambush tactics and mimicry of objects, Elder Blood Mimics, like regular Blood Mimics possess to ability to copy creatures. What really sets Elder Blood Mimics apart is a special Core that functions as their heart and along with extreme intelligence and reasoning ability gives them the terrifying ability to dominate and control entire colonies of mimics and blood mimics alike. Their presence warps the environment around them, transforming once-thriving settlements into twisted nightmares where every object could be a predator.\nThese creatures are exceedingly rare, with only a handful known to exist across the planes. Each Elder Blood Mimic is unique, shaped by the environment it has dominated and the prey it has consumed. They are highly intelligent, capable of complex strategies and manipulation, often creating symbiotic relations with humanoid civilizations to ensure a steady food supply.\nElder Blood Mimics are driven by an insatiable hunger, not just for flesh or power. They seek to expand their influence, often corrupting or consuming anything that threatens their dominion. Killing an Elder Blood Mimic is no small feat. Their hive mind ensures that even in death, their influence can linger, requiring the destruction of their core to sever their connection to their kin\n\n\n\nElder Blood Mimic\nGargantuan Aberration, Chaotic Evil\n\nArmor Class 17 (natural armor)\nHit Points 310 (20d12 + 160)\nSpeed 30 ft., climb 30 ft.\n\nSTRDEXCONINTWISCHA\n20 (+5)12 (+1)26 (+8)24 (+7)20 (+5)12 (+1)\n\n\nSaving Throws Strength +10, Constitution +12, Wisdom +6, Charisma +9\nDamage Resistances Nonmagical piercing, bludgeoning, and slashing\nDamage Immunities Acid, Psychic\nSenses Blindsight 120 ft., Passive Perception 20\nLanguages Common, Deep Speech, telepathy 120 ft.\n\nChallenge 13\nProficiency Bonus +5\n\n\nTraits\nAmorphous.

If the Elder Blood Mimic fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.\nHive Mind. All mimics within 1 mile of the Elder Blood Mimic are telepathically connected to it and act as extensions of its will. While the Elder Blood Mimic lives, all mimics within this radius have advantage on attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks.\nMimicry Overload. The Elder Blood Mimic can use an action to command all mimics within its lair to shapeshift simultaneously, creating chaos and confusion. Each creature within 60 feet of a mimic must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute.\nActions\nMultiattack. The Elder Blood Mimic makes three attacks: one with its pseudopod and two with its Bite.\nPseudopod. Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target.

Hit: 22 (4d8 + 6) piercing damage. If the target is grappled by the Elder Blood Mimic, the bite deals an additional 14 (4d6) acid damage.\nFeast of the Abyss (Recharge 5-6). The Elder Blood Mimic chooses a spot it can see within 60 ft. All creatures within a 15 ft radius must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 6d8 necrotic damage, and the Elder Blood Mimic regains hit points equal to half the damage dealt. On a successful save, the target takes half damage, and the Elder Blood Mimic regains no hit points.\nReactions\nSymbiotic Resilience. 3 times per long rest, when the Elder Blood Mimic takes damage, it can roll a d6.

The area becomes difficult terrain.\nRising Walls. The mimic-controlled city shifts, causing walls of stone and wood to erupt from the ground. The Elder Blood Mimic creates a 30-foot-long, 10-foot-high wall anywhere within its lair. The wall provides total cover and lasts until the mimic uses this lair action again or dies.\nUrban Distortion. The streets twist and buckle under the mimic’s control. Each creature within 60 feet of the Elder Blood Mimic must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone as the ground shifts violently.\nWarping Streets.

A tentaclaw can’t be more than 30 feet away from the Quacken, and if the Quacken moving would result in a tentaclaw being beyond this range, the tentaclaw moves with the Quacken. If a Quacken’s tentaclaw is reduced to 0 hit points, it separates from the Quacken and goes inert. If the Quacken is reduced to 0 hit points, the tentaclaw is reduced to 0 hit points as well.\nCondition Sharing. If the Quacken is blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, incapacitated, petrified, poisoned, or stunned, the tentaclaw gains that condition as well, losing its immunity for the duration.\nSiege Monster. The tentaclaw deals double damage to objects and structures.\nActions\nSlam. Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. Hit: 2d6 + 4 bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 17). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained.\nFling. One Large or smaller object held or creature grappled by the Quacken is thrown up to 60 feet in a random direction and knocked prone. If a thrown target strikes a solid surface, the target takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked prone.\n","id":"https://nooberieno.github.io/DnD-Homebrew/beastiary/juvenile-quacken-tentaclaw/","title":"Juvenile Quacken Tentaclaw"},"https://nooberieno.github.io/DnD-Homebrew/beastiary/juvenile-quacken/":{"body":"The child of a Quacken.

The Quacken deals double damage to objects and structures.\nTentaclaws. The Quacken has six tentaclaws. A Quacken’s tentaclaw has its own stat block, but shares the Quacken’s senses and can’t act independently from the Quacken. The Quacken commands and moves its tentaclaws on its turn, according to its Multi-attack action. A tentaclaw can’t be more than 30 feet away from the Quacken, and if the Quacken moving would result in a tentaclaw being beyond this range, the tentaclaw moves with the Quacken. If a Quacken’s tentaclaw is reduced to 0 hit points, it separates from the Quacken and goes inert. If the Quacken is reduced to 0 hit points, all its tentaclaws are reduced to 0 hit points as well. The Quacken regrows all lost tentaclaws when it finishes a long rest.\nActions\nMulti-attack. The Quacken has up to three of its tentaclaws each move up to its speed and make a single Slam attack or Fling each. It can replace one of these tentaclaw actions with a use of its Maw instead.\nMaw. Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 2d8 + 4 piercing damage. Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained. If the target is a Large or smaller creature grappled by the Quacken, that creature is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the Quacken, and it takes 8d6 acid damage at the start of each of the Quacken's turns. If the Quacken takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the Quacken must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the Quacken. If the Quacken dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone.\nTyphoon (Recharge 5-6). The Quacken flaps its wings, creating a column of wind and lightning in a 5-foot-radius, 30-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within 30 feet of it. Each creature within 10 feet of the cylinder must make a DC 17 Strength saving throw. This saving throw is made with disadvantage if a creature is within the space of the cylinder. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage, plus 3d6 cold damage, plus 3d6 lightning damage, is pulled to the top of the cylinder, and then thrown 30 feet horizontally in a random direction. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t moved.\nBonus Actions\nRegenerate. If the Quacken has fewer than six tentaclaws, it can choose to take 75 necrotic damage, which can’t be reduced or prevented in any way. A new tentaclaw then grows from its body, appearing with 75 hit points in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the Quacken.\nReactions\nOff a Duck’s Back. When the Quacken takes damage, it can choose to roll a d6. On a roll of 5 or higher, the Quacken takes no damage instead.\nLegendary Actions\nTentaclaw. The Quacken has one of its tentaclaws move up to its speed and make a Slam attack or use its Fling.\nWing Attack (Costs 2 Actions). The Quacken beats its wings. Each creature within 10 feet of the Quacken must succeed on a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw or take 17 (2d6 + 10) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The Quacken can then fly or swim up to half its flying or swimming speed.\nTentaclaw Snapback (Costs 3 Actions). Each of the Quacken’s tentaclaws moves up to 40 feet in a straight line towards the Quacken, moving through other creatures’ spaces as it does so. When a tentaclaw moves into a creature’s space, that creature must make a DC 23 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d6 + 10 bludgeoning damage and is pulled by the tentaclaw to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the Quacken. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and moves to an unoccupied space of its choice within 5 feet of the tentaclaw.\n","id":"https://nooberieno.github.io/DnD-Homebrew/beastiary/juvenile-quacken/","title":"Juvenile Quacken"},"https://nooberieno.github.io/DnD-Homebrew/beastiary/selachian-sandstalker/":{"body":"The jaws of the desert\nGeneral Lore\nSelachian Sandstalkers are immense desert-dwelling shark-like creatures that prowl beneath the sands of desolate, sun-blasted wastelands. Resembling a hybrid of monstrous sand sharks and armored subterranean predators, these creatures have adapted perfectly to their harsh environment. Their sleek, finned bodies allow them to glide effortlessly through sand as though it were water, and their tough, chitinous armor provides both defense and camouflage against the ever-shifting desert dunes.\nPhysical Characteristics\n\nSize: Adults range from 20 to 50 feet in length, with dorsal fins that occasionally breach the sand like the infamous oceanic great white sharks.\nColoration: Selachian Sandstalkers are typically sand-colored, ranging from pale beige to deep rust red, with intricate striping that mimics the natural contours of desert dunes.\nFins and Armor: Their dorsal and pectoral fins are thick and sharp, capable of slicing through rock and reinforced desert structures. The armored ridges along their backs bristle with spines to deter larger predators or rivals.\nMaw: Their maws are lined with concentric rings of serrated teeth, which they use to swallow prey whole or crush any obstacles in their path.\n\nBehavior\n\nAttraction to Vibrations: Like the legendary sandworms of other realms, Selachian Sandstalkers are drawn to surface vibrations, whether from footsteps, the thudding of hooves, or the rhythmic pounding of desert storms. They can detect even faint disturbances from miles away.\nBurrowing Tactics: They lurk beneath the sands and ambush prey, bursting from below in a whirlwind of dust, teeth, and churning sand.\nHerding Instincts: Though solitary for much of their lives, certain conditions—such as seasonal migrations or the lure of ancient desert ruins—can draw them together into \"shoals,\" making vast areas of desert impassable without risk of attack.\n\n\n\nSelachian Sandstalker\nHuge Monstrosity, Unaligned\n\nTraits\nArmor Class 18 (natural armor, chitinous plates)\nHit Points 310 (23d12+161)\nSpeed 40 ft., burrow 60 ft., swim 30 ft.\n\nSTRDEXCONINTWISCHA\n26 (+8)12 (+1)24 (+7)5 (-3)16 (+3)9 (-1)\n\n\nSaving Throws Strength +11, Dexterity +5, Constitution +11, Wisdom +7\nDamage Resistances fire, bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks\nDamage Immunities poison\nSenses tremorsense 120 ft., blindsight 60 ft., passive Perception 17\nLanguages —\n\nChallenge 15\nProficiency Bonus 5\n\n\nAmphibious Predator. The Selachian Sandstalker can breathe both air and water. It can also move through sand, earth, and loose soil as easily as swimming through water.\nSand Glide. The Sandstalker can burrow through nonmagical, unworked sand without disturbing the material it moves through. While burrowing, it is considered to have full cover.\nTremor Lure. The Sandstalker is aware of all vibrations in the ground within 120 feet. It has advantage on attack rolls against any creature touching the ground.\nSiege Monster. The Sandstalker deals double damage to objects and structures.\nActions\nMultiattack. The Sandstalker makes two attacks: one with its Bite and one with its Fin Slash.\nBite. Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 36 (5d10+8) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 19 Strength saving throw or be swallowed. A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, has total cover against attacks and effects outside the Sandstalker, and takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the Sandstalker’s turns. If the Sandstalker takes 40 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, it must succeed on a DC 19 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of it.\nFin Slash. Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 24 (4d8+8) slashing damage.\nSand Eruption (Recharge 5–6). The Sandstalker bursts up from beneath the sands in a 30-foot radius eruption. Each creature in the area must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw, taking 45 (10d8) bludgeoning damage and being knocked prone on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The area becomes difficult terrain until cleared.\nReactions\nThrash. When a creature the Sandstalker has swallowed deals damage to it, the Sandstalker thrashes violently. Each creature within 15 feet must succeed on a DC 19 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.\n","id":"https://nooberieno.github.io/DnD-Homebrew/beastiary/selachian-sandstalker/","title":"Selachian Sandstalker"},"https://nooberieno.github.io/DnD-Homebrew/beastiary/transfigured-humanoid/":{"body":"\n\nTransfigured Humanoid\nMedium Monstrosity, Shares the Creator's Alignment\n\nArmor Class 16 (natural armor)\nHit Points 19 (3d8 + 6)\nSpeed 20 ft., swim 10 ft.\n\nSTRDEXCONINTWISCHA\n16 (+3)8 (-1)15 (+2)5 (-3)6 (-2)3 (-4)\n\n\nDamage Resistances necrotic\nSenses darkvision 30 ft., Passive Perception 8\nLanguages understands the languages it knew in life, but can't speak, only produce vague sounds; it may call people's names if they knew them in life\n\nChallenge 1/2\nProficiency Bonus +2\n\n\nTransfigured. The Transfigured Humanoid has disadvantage on checks to prevent itself being transfigured again by its creator, and it will defend itself in combat if attacked.\nTortured Existence. The Transfigured Humanoid lives a life of constant agony, always in a haze of pain and confusion, half remembering who it was as its creator forces it to act against its will. Additionally, the Transfigured Humanoid does not heal on its own.\nUnstable Flesh. The Transfigured Humanoid can grow and absorb its flesh as needed to protect itself or its creator. Twice a day the Transfigured Humanoid can alter its flesh, either gaining +2 AC as a reaction, increasing its reach with slam by 5 ft, or increasing the damage from slam by +3. This effect is lost when the Transfigured Humanoid's turn ends as its fatigued flesh returns to normal.\nActions\nDual Slam. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.

Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your cartomancer level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.\nFor example, if you're a 4th-level cartomancer, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.\nSpellcasting\nYour skill and prowess with cards and the arcane cards you posses are the source of your spells.\nCantrips\nAt 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cartomancer spell list. You learn additional cartomancer cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the cartomancer table.\nSpell Slots\nThe cartomancer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your cartomancer spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these cartomancer spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\nSpells Known of 1st level or higher\nYou know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the cartomancer spell list.\nYou learn an additional cartomancer spell of your choice at each level except 12th, 14th, 16th, 18th, 19th, and 20th. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.\nAdditionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the cartomancer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the cartomancer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\nSpellcasting ability\nIntelligence is your spellcasting ability for your cartomancer spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cartomancer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;Spell save DC = 8 + int + Proficiency Bonus\n&nbsp;&nbsp;Spell attack modifier = int + Proficiency Bonus\nRitual Casting\nYou can cast any cartomancer spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag\nDeck of Cards\nChoose your arcane deck of cards, which describe the deck you possess, from the list of available decks.\nYour choice grants you features when you choose it at 1st level and again at 6th, 14th and 18th level.\nYour deck of cards is the heart of your magic and is where you store your spells. Should this deck be destroyed you lose the ability to access all spells and features grant by your deck, except cantrips which are fixed in your mind.  If you can find a deck with the same symbols and number of cards, you can spend 1 hour to turn it your deck.\n\n    Tarot Deck\n\"Each card carries a story, a secret, a truth waiting to be unveiled. Through the Tarot, you glimpse the weave of fate — and bend it to your will.\"\nTarot Deck Cartomancers are seers and fate-weavers, drawing power from prophecy and symbolism. Unlike the trickery of Jokers or the sharp odds of Poker, Tarot focuses on foresight, destiny, and manipulating probability in subtle but devastating ways.\nThis deck contains 78 cards: 56 Minor Arcana split evenly into 4 suits (Cups, Pentacles, Wands and Swords) and 22 Major Arcana\nNote: If you have an actual Tarot Deck with 22 Major Arcana cards, you can draw a card from it for the Arcana's Whisper(Major) instead of rolling dice.\nDeck Spells\n1st-level Tarot Deck feature\nYour deck infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells.

You can speak the language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message's presence with a successful 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but can't decipher it without magic.\nSpellcasting\nDrawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the druid spell list.\nCantrips\nAt 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table.\nPreparing and Casting Spells\nThe Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your druid spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\nYou prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\nFor example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.\nYou can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.\nSpellcasting Ability\nWisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;Spell save DC = 8 + wis + Proficiency Bonus\n&nbsp;&nbsp;Spell attack modifier = wis + Proficiency Bonus\nRitual Casting\nYou can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.\nSpellcasting Focus\nYou can use a druidic focus as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.\nWild Shape\nStarting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.\nYour druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn't have a flying or swimming speed.\nLevelMax. CRLimitationsExample\n2nd1/4No flying or swimming speedWolf\n4th1/2No flying speedCrocodile\n8th1—Giant eagle\n\nYou can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.\nWhile you are transformed, the following rules apply:\n\nYour game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.\nWhen you transform, you assume the beast's hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked unconscious.\nYou can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you've already cast.\nYou retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.\nYou choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.\n\nWild Companion\n2nd-level druid optional feature\nYou gain the ability to summon a spirit that assumes an animal form: as an action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to cast the find familiar spell, without material components.\nWhen you cast the spell in this way, the familiar is a fey instead of a beast, and the familiar disappears after a number of hours equal to half your druid level.\nDruid Circle\nAt 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids from the list of available circles. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.\n\n    Circle of the Tides Druid\n\nCircle of the Tides Druids are fierce guardians of the sea and all that live inside of it. Their order gathers in the ocean to share news and trade warnings. It is said that 5 of these druids together can cause a hurricane.\n\nCircle Spells\n2th-level Circle of the Tides Druid feature\nAt 2nd level, your connection to the ocean grants you access to certain spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels listed in the Circle of the Tides Spells table. Once you gain access to a Circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain a spell that doesn’t appear on the druid spell list, it is nonetheless a druid spell for you.\nDruid LevelSpells\n2ndHealing Word, Fog Cloud\n3rdMisty Step, Prayer of Healing\n5thTidal Wave, Wall of Water, Mass Healing Word\n7thControl Water, Watery Sphere\n9thMaelstrom, Cone of Cold\n\nOceanic Blessing\n2th-level Circle of the Tides Druid feature\nYou use Wild Shape to transform into creatures that have a swimming speed at 2nd and 3rd level. Additionally you can breath in water and have a swimming speed equal to your walking speed while not wearing heavy armor.\nOcean's Embrace\n2th-level Circle of the Tides Druid feature\nStarting at 2nd level, you gain the ability to call upon the power of the tides to protect yourself or others. As a bonus action, you can surround yourself or a creature you can see within 30 feet with a swirling barrier of water for 1 minute. The barrier grants the following effects:\n\nThe target gains temporary hit points equal to your druid level + your Wisdom modifier.\nThe target’s movement speed decreases by 10 feet.\nThe target has resistance to fire damage.\n\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\nThe target gains temporary hit points equal to your druid level + your Wisdom modifier.\nThe target’s movement speed decreases by 10 feet.\nThe target has resistance to fire damage.\n\n\nWild Shape Improvement\nAt 4th level, your Wild Shape improves as shown on the Beast Shapes table.\nAbility Score Improvement\nWhen you reach 4th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nIf your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.\nCantrip Versatility\n4th-level druid optional feature\nWhenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can replace one cantrip you learned from this class's Spellcasting feature with another cantrip from the druid spell list.\nDruid Circle feature\nAt 6th level, you gain a feature granted by your Druid Circle.\n\n    Tidal Mastery\n6th-level Circle of the Tides Druid feature\nAt 6th level, you can command the tides to aid your allies or hinder your foes. When you cast a spell that creates or manipulates water, such as Tidal Wave or Control Water, you can choose one of the following additional effects:\n\nSurging Tide: You can push creatures within the affected area up to 10 feet in a direction of your choice.\nRejuvenating Waters: Allies within the affected area regain hit points equal to your druid level.\n\n\nWild Shape Improvement\nAt 8th level, your Wild Shape improves as shown on the Beast Shapes table.\nAbility Score Improvement\nWhen you reach 8th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nIf your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.\nDruid Circle feature\nAt 10th level, you gain a feature granted by your Druid Circle feature.\n\n    Tidal Aura\n10th-level Circle of the Tides Druid feature\nAs a bonus action, you can expend a use of Wild Shape to exude a mystical watery force in a 30 ft radius. Creatures of your choice within this Aura treat it as difficult terrain. If a creature has a swimming speed it ignores this effect. Your Tidal Aura also enhances your healing powers. When you cast a spell that restores hit points to a creature within this Tidal Aura, all allied creatures within the Aura regains additional hit points equal to Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1) + your druid level. your Tidal Aura lasts for 1 minute. Its effects end early  if you end it as a bonus action, or if you are incapacitated.\n\nAbility Score Improvement\nWhen you reach 12th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nIf your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.\nDruid Circle feature\nAt 14th level, you gain a feature granted by your Druid Circle feature.\n\n    Waters of Life\n14th-level Circle of the Tides Druid feature\nYou can activate Tidal Aura without expending a use of Wild Shape. Once activating Tidal Aura this way, you cannot do so again until you have completed a long rest. Creatures of your choice treat the area your Tidal Aura is occupying as difficult terrain if they have a swimming speed.  Tidal Aura now gives temporary hit points equal to your druid level to creatures of your choice on the beginning of each of their turns if they start their turn in the Tidal Aura. Allied creatures in your Tidal Aura reduce fire damage by an amount equal to your druid level.\n\nAbility Score Improvement\nWhen you reach 16th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nIf your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.\nTimeless Body\nStarting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you to age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year.\nBeast Spells\nBeginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your druid spells in any shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic and verbal components of a druid spell while in a beast shape, but you aren't able to provide material components.\nAbility Score Improvement\nWhen you reach 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nIf your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a feat.\nArchdruid\nAt 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of times.\nAdditionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of your druid spells, as well as any material components that lack a cost and aren't consumed by a spell. You gain this benefit in both your normal shape and your beast shape from Wild Shape.\n","id":"https://nooberieno.github.io/DnD-Homebrew/classes-subclasses/druid/","title":"Druid"},"https://nooberieno.github.io/DnD-Homebrew/classes-subclasses/fighter/":{"body":"\n  \n    \n      Level\n      Proficiency Bonus\n      Features\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      1\n      +2\n      Fighting Style, Second Wind\n    \n    \n      2\n      +2\n      Action Surge\n    \n    \n      3\n      +2\n      Martial Archetype\n    \n    \n      4\n      +2\n      Ability Score Improvement, Martial Versatility\n    \n    \n      5\n      +3\n      Extra Attack\n    \n    \n      6\n      +3\n      Ability Score Improvement\n    \n    \n      7\n      +3\n      Martial Archetype feature\n    \n    \n      8\n      +3\n      Ability Score Improvement\n    \n    \n      9\n      +4\n      Indomitable\n    \n    \n      10\n      +4\n      Martial Archetype feature\n    \n    \n      11\n      +4\n      Extra Attack (2)\n    \n    \n      12\n      +4\n      Ability Score Improvement\n    \n    \n      13\n      +5\n      Indomitable (two uses)\n    \n    \n      14\n      +5\n      Ability Score Improvement\n    \n    \n      15\n      +5\n      Martial Archetype feature\n    \n    \n      16\n      +5\n      Ability Score Improvement\n    \n    \n      17\n      +6\n      Action Surge (two uses), Indomitable (three uses)\n    \n    \n      18\n      +6\n      Martial Archetype feature\n    \n    \n      19\n      +6\n      Ability Score Improvement\n    \n    \n      20\n      +6\n      Extra Attack (3)\n    \n  \n\n\n    Fighter\nHit Dice: 1d10\nProficiencies:\n\nArmor: light, medium, heavy, shield\nWeapons: simple, martial\nSkills: Choose 2 from acrobatics, animal handling, athletics, history, insight, intimidation, perception, survival\n\nStarting Equipment:\n\n(a) chain mail or (b) leather armor, longbow, and 20 arrows\n(a) a martial weapon and a shield or (b) two martial weapons\n(a) a light crossbow and 20 bolts or (b) two handaxes\n(a) a dungeoneer's pack or (b) an explorer's pack\n\nMulticlassing Requirements:\n\nSTR 13 or DEX 13\n\n\n\nSubclasses\n\n    Heavenly Restricted Fighter\nClass Features\nFighting Style\nYou adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty.

Bleeding can be applied multiple times to the same target, up to a maximum of 4 times.\nEffects of Bleeding\nAt the start of each turn the bleeding creature takes a d4 of damage for each for each Level of Bleeding  it has, up to a maximum of 4d4 damage. This damage has no type and cannot be reduced in any way. The bleeding creature has disadvantage on Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration. Bleeding creatures have disadvantage on saving throw to resist disease, as their open wound can easily be infected.\nEnding the Condition\nBleeding is ended when the target receives magical healing, to end this condition, a creature needs to receive 1 hp of magical healing per level of Bleeding. Bleeding can also be ended by passing a Medicine Check with access to a healers kit or by spending an action to make a Constitution saving throw, the DC for both of these is equal to 13 + the amount of levels in Bleeding you have. Additionally sufficient fire damage can cauterize the wound, stopping the bleeding. What counts as sufficient fire damage is up to the DM. 1 Bleeding level can be removed upon finishing a short rest. All levels of Bleeding are removed by finishing a long rest.\nImmunities\nCreatures with no blood cannot bleed, this includes Undead, Constructs, Elementals, Spirits and Oozes.

Frenzied gets worse over time if not cured or subdued.\nEffects of Frenzied\nFrenzied is measured in 6 levels.

There are 2 main types: Elemental Infusion Stones and Condition Infusion Stones\nEffects\nThe effect of an Infusion Stone is based on what type of Infusion Stone it is.\nElemental Stones\nWhen rolling for damage using weapon which has an Elemental Infusion Stone applied to it, the weapon deals 1d6 additional damage of the damage type of the Elemental Stone (A weapon with a Fire Infusion Stone deals 1d6 additional fire damage).\nCondition Stones\nWhen a creature is hit with a weapon that has a Condition Infusion Stone applied to it, it must make a Constitution Saving Throw with\n&nbsp;&nbsp;DC = 9 + Proficiency + Dex or Str.\nUpon failure the creature is affected by the Condition of the Condition Stone (A weapon with a Blind Infusion Stone will cause Blindness upon a failed save). The creature may reroll the save at the end of each of its turns. The condition lasts until the creature succeeds the save or until 3 rounds have passed since the creature has gained the condition from the Condition Stone, whichever happens first.\nApplying Infusion Stones\nApplying Infusion Stones is a tricky 10 minute process, which is most commonly done by blacksmiths or weapon smiths. The duration and charges of the effects rely on the type of Infusion Stone.\nYou can apply multiple of the same Elemental Stone to a weapon, as long as that weapon does not already have a different Elemental Stone applied. In this case, only the Duration increases, not the effects.\nElemental Stones\nTo apply an Elemental Stone, roll 1d6. This is the number of weeks that the stone will be active.\nCondition Stones\nTo apply a Condition Stone, roll 1d4 and 1d10. The result of the d4 is the number of weeks the stone will be active. The result of the d10 is the number of charges. A charge is removed each time a creature gains the Condition via use of this stone. If there are charges left over and the stone is no longer active, all charges will disappear.\nApplying Infusion Stones Yourself\nWhile you can apply Infusion Stones yourself, it is going to yield worse results than when someone who has experience in handling magical weapons. When rolling for the duration of the Infusion Stone, roll with disadvantage.\nIf you are proficient with Smith's Tools you may reroll and 1's on the duration dice once per die.\nApplying Infusion Stones to Ammo\nAn Infusion Stone can also be applied to ammunition*, such as arrows, bolts or bullets. However, because ammo is designed to be expended, the enchantment within an Infusion Stone will burn out more quickly.\nAn Infusion Stone can enchant a maximum of 20 pieces of ammunition at once. Once a piece of ammunition is fired, it always loses it enchantment even if it is physically recovered. As with regular weapons, you may not mix Infusion Stones on the same bundle of ammunition. If the ammunition has a Condition Stone applied to it, 2 charges are deducted instead of 1\n*The weapon used to launch the ammunition can also have an Infusion Stone applied to it. In this case, the Elemental Stones work as normal, Condition Stones keep the 2 charges cost.\nList of Infusion Stones with Prices\nStone TypeEffectRaritySuggested Price (GP)\nFire Stone+1d6 fire damageUncommon500\nCold Stone+1d6 cold damageUncommon500\nLightning Stone+1d6 lightning damageUncommon600\nAcid Stone+1d6 acid damageUncommon600\nPoison Stone+1d6 poison damageUncommon300\nRadiant Stone+1d6 radiant damageRare1,200\nNecrotic Stone+1d6 necrotic damageRare1,000\nBlind StoneBlindedRare2,000\nDeaf StoneDeafenedUncommon300\nFear StoneFrightenedRare1,800\nSlow StoneSlowedRare2,500\nRoot StoneRestrainedVery Rare4,000\nCharm StoneCharmedRare1,500\nConfusion StoneConfusedVery Rare3,500\nSilence StoneSilencedRare2,000\nThere are no Infusion Stones that cause the Unconscious, Paralysis or Stunned conditions\n\nAdditional Condition Stones For Tome of The Tarnished Conditions\nStone TypeEffectRaritySuggested Price (GP)\nBlood StoneBleedingRare1,000\nMadness StoneFrenziedRare2,500\nDecaying StoneRottingVery Rare4,000\n\n","id":"https://nooberieno.github.io/DnD-Homebrew/items/infusion-stones/","title":"Infusion Stones"},"https://nooberieno.github.io/DnD-Homebrew/items/preserving-bolus/":{"body":"Woundrous Item, Rare\nThese scarlet boluses are made from cave moss infected by Scarlet Rot.

They have tentacles for lower limbs, dexterous upper limbs, and an innate connection to the ocean. Many Cephalkin are daring adventurers, pirates, or explorers who seek the freedom of the seas and beyond. Cephalkin civilizations are found in deep oceans hidden from sight.\nAppearance\nCephalkin mostly characterized by the fact that they have 8 tentacles for lower limbs, their facial tentacles which resemble the facial hair of other humanoids, darker skin tones, which come in variety of colors, that they use to disguise themselves, trying to look like coral.  Their upper limbs consist of dexterous appendages, which at first glance look like arms, but they are way more dexterous and bend in unnatural ways.

When you do so, you can change the color and pattern of your skin to match your surroundings.

Your tentacle reach is 5 feet longer than normal.\nSubrace\nWhen you choose a race, you also need to pick one of the subraces listed below\nSubraces: Octoid, Coleoid, Nautiloid\n\n    Octoid Cephalkin\n\n\n    Coleoid Cephalkin\n\n\n    Nautiloid Cephalkin\n\n\n    Octoid Cephalkin\n\nOctoids possess strong, versatile tentacles, making them excellent grapplers and close-combat specialists.\n\nOctoid Cephalkin have the most developed tentacles out of all Cephalkin, this is to navigate the deep ocean floors they live on and catch prey effectively. Octoid Cephalkin have increased muscle growth compared to other Cephalkin. Octoids often venture on land to learn martial arts and how to wield weapons, as nothing brings them more joy then to show of their strength. Many a wrestling champion has been or been the student of an Octoid Cephalkin.\nAbility Score Increase.\nYour Strength score increases by 1.\nSuperior Darkvision\nAccustomed to the extreme low light environment of the deep oceans, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions.

It is however a common explanation for Coleoid's more pronounced stealth and nimbleness. Coleoid Cephalkin have the weakest, yet most flexible tentacles and although their tentacles are weak, the suction cups on them are extremely well developed, allowing them to stick to most surfaces. Coleoids can be recognized by their signature pointy head shape, reminiscent of their distant squid cousins.\nAbility Score Increase.\nYour Charisma score increases by 1.\nDarkvision\nAccustomed to low light environments of deep oceans, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\nEnhanced Camouflage.\nAs an action, you can blend into your surroundings, gaining advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks for 1 minute.

These Cephalkin live at the lowest of depths and have the hardest time adjusting to land, finding that their shell slows them down when walking. Nautiloid Cephalkin often have many facial tentacles, which is often considered creepy by other humanoid races. Nautiloids are easily recognized by the spiral shell covering their heads, which contain and protect their brains. This means Nautiloids will die if their shell is removed. Their shell has made them quite the target for bandits and poachers, as armor created from a Nautiloid's shell lighter and more durable than any metal.\nAbility Score Increase.\nYour Constitution score increases by 1.\nSuperior Darkvision\nAccustomed to the extreme low light environment of the deep oceans, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions.

Only Equinoid couples stay together for long periods of time, for good reason.\nCoupling\nAn Equinoid couple is formed through ritual, binding their fates. Should one member die or should the couple be separated for long periods of time, then the Equinoid are cursed. They are cursed with increasingly bad luck.

Knocking an enemy into a wall makes them fall prone. You must be able to push the target to be able to charge at it.\n\n\nFlight: You can use your reaction to make a dexterity saving throw of DC 18.

Whatever the case they are now being chased by a massive amount of creatures. Hoard Chase encounters are a good way to force your players into a specific place without railroading them. Say you want them out of a dungeon, you could have tens or even hundreds of monsters appear from the behind the walls that they suddenly need to escape from, but how does that work?\nCreating a Hoard Chase\nHoard Chases only really work well in an area with 1 or more straightforward paths to follow, like a cityscape with lots of streets or a dungeon with a large corridor. A hoard encounter doesn't make much sense and are harder to run in large open areas like a plains.\nStarting a Hoard Chase\nMake sure everyone that is not in combat rolls for initiative, including the hoard. The hoard is always treated like a single target. Make sure the hoard is not too close to your players, 10 ft is good distance between the hoard and the players. A hoard chase typically blocks of the place where the hoard came from.\nVariant Rule: Parkour Master\nChase initiative should be different from combat initiative, as it is not about fast hands or quick reflexes, but all about stamina, who can sustain high speeds and quickly overcome physical obstacles. Instead of rolling a dexterity check, roll an Athletics (speed) or Constitution (stamina) check to determine initiative order. Any bonuses to initiative a player has, such as the Alert feat still apply.\nRunning a Hoard Chase\nA hoard is special in that it has no hit points, the chase only ends when the party meets a condition, like escaping. If your hoard is made up of lower Cr. monsters, like goblins, whenever a player deals a significant amount of damage to the hoard, you could say that one or more of the goblin dies, but the hoard rampages on and 2 new goblins appear from the wall to replace their fallen kin. So a hoard has no hp, then whats the use of hitting it? Dealing damage to the hoard slows it down. A hoard starts its first turn with 10 ft of movement and every turn the players fail to damage it, it gains 20 ft of movement. If a hoard has not gained new movement in at least 2 turns, it gains 5 ft of movement. This can be described as the hoard coordinating better or growing larger as time goes on. Should the hoard can try to move onto a square in which a player is standing, that player needs to make a DC 15 Dexterity Saving Throw or be swallowed by the hoard. If the hoard wants to kill the players, the player takes 5d6 points of either, Bludgeoning, Slashing or Piercing damage that counts as magical for the purposes of overcoming resistances and immunities. If the hoard wants to capture the players, the player is grappled and moves when the hoard moves and can break free on a DC 15 Athletics or Acrobatics check. The hoard counts as difficult terrain for the player while they are inside of it. Another player can use the help action to pull an ally out of the hoard, if they are within 5 ft of the player they are trying to help. The player inside the hoard needs to make the DC 15 Dexterity Saving Throw and on success is pulled out of the hoard.\nDashing During the Chase\n“During the chase, a participant can freely use the Dash action a number of times equal to 3 + its Constitution modifier. Each additional Dash action it takes during the chase requires the creature to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution check”  CHECK, not saving throw “at the end of its turn or gain one level of exhaustion.” (DMG p. 252)\nRandom Complications\nA the end of a players' turn or the hoard's turn a random complication can happen, roll on random complications table (DMG p. 254) to see what happens. A complication does not disappear if it has been overcome, unless it was an instantaneous effect, but a hoard is not hindered by obstacles as they steamroll their way over everything in their path. You may rule that an obstacle is easier to overcome once someone has already done it. Only 1 random complication should happen per round.\nEnding the Chase\nA hoard chase has a lot less ending conditions, then a regular chase, since a hoard cannot dash or die. A hoard chase is ended when :\n\nThe hoard has killed or caught all players\nThe players escape\nThe players meet a condition of your choice (such as flipping a lever to close a door)\n\n","id":"https://nooberieno.github.io/DnD-Homebrew/rules/hoard-chase-encounters/","title":"Hoard Chase Encounters"},"https://nooberieno.github.io/DnD-Homebrew/spells/":{"body":"","id":"https://nooberieno.github.io/DnD-Homebrew/spells/","title":"Spells"},"https://nooberieno.github.io/DnD-Homebrew/spells/ashes-to-ashes/":{"body":"Level 9 Evocation Spell\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: self(150 ft radius)\nComponents: V, S, M(a phoenix heart which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nClasses: Sorcerer, Warlock\nSubclasses: Light Domain Cleric\n\nYou think you're a god, lets test that theory shall we\n\nDescription\nYou ignite yourself with an immense, fiery explosion that deals devastating damage to all creatures around you, including yourself.
