# Taurian
Here is an overview of the Taurian language learned by [Equinoids]({{site.baseurl}}/Races%20of%20Anur/Equinoid). 

_Note_: The current Taurian is unfinished and will likely never be finished

## Each consonant in the language has a website linked where you can hear how it is pronounced.

## Vowels:

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
||Front|Central|Back|
|High|i, i:||u, u:|
|Mid|e, e:|œ|o, o:|
|Low||a, a:||

Each vowel is pronounced as in English, with a ‘:’ meaning an extended vowel. In Taurian an extended vowel can also be denoted like ï, ë, ä, ü, ö.
# Syllable Structure
## Basic syllable terminology
### The three parts of a syllable
Any syllable consists of up to three parts. The onset, nucleus, and the coda.

- The onset is the consonant that begins the syllable, like the ‘c’ in ‘cat’.
    
- The nucleus is the vowel(s) in the middle of a syllable, like the ‘a’ in ‘cat’.
    
- The coda is a consonant that ends a syllable and precedes the onset of the next syllable or the end of the word, like the ‘t’ in cat. 

Note that the coda is not necessary. Some examples of what the coda is in some simple words is listed below.

- [akta] - coda: /k/
    
- [akat] -  coda: /t/
    
- [kata] -  no codas

A syllable with no coda is an open syllable. 

A syllable with a coda is a closed syllable.

Note that it is possible for any of the three parts of a syllable to be more than 1 letter, like in the english ‘strengths’ where ‘gths’ is a 4 letter coda.
### Long/short syllables
Syllables can be long or short. A syllable is long if it contains a vowel that is long by nature or a vowel that is followed by two consonants other than a mute (c, g, p, b, t, d) or f followed by a liquid (r, l).

- [aktá] - [tá] is long
    
- [akka] - [ak] is long
    
- [akta] - nothing is long
    
### Syllable stress
The stressed syllable is the syllable that has a longer, louder, and higher sound than the other syllables in the word.
## Syllable structure in the Taurian language
This part goes over all parts of syllable structure that pertain to the construction of words for the Taurian language
### Syllable shape 
In the Taurian language there are no closed syllables, meaning any syllable must end on a vowel.
### Stress System
In the Taurian language the stress falls on the third-to-last-syllable unless the second to last syllable is long.

- Hakatu – HA-ka-tu
    
- Hakätu – ha-KA-tu
# Root words

Sœ – We/us
Tsœ – You (plural)
Wœ – They/them

## Nouns

## Rest / can belong to multiple

Së – This

Në – That

Sa – Here

Na – There

Sha – Who

Sho – What

Shi – Where

Shu – When

Shë – How

Tonoto – All

Tonota – Many

# Syntax
## Basic word order

Every known language separates sentences into objects, subjects and verbs. These are placed into a specific order so that you know which is which. In the sentence ‘The dog eats the animal’ we know that the dog is the one that is eating the animal because of where it is placed in the sentence, and the meaning flips if we write the sentence as ‘The animal eats the dog’. 

In the Taurian language words are placed in the SOV (subject-object-verb) order. This means that ‘The dog eats the animal’ would be phrased as ‘The dog the animal eats’.
## Adjectives
In any language, adjectives either evolved from nouns or verbs. This changes where they are placed. In the Taurian language adjectives evolved from nouns, and thus come before the word they pertain to. This is just like in english.
## Adpositions
In English we have prepositions, but there are also postpositions. Whether a language has prepositions or postpositions depends on whether its adpositions (umbrella term for both) evolved from nouns or verbs. 
In the Taurian language they evolved from verbs. This means that over time something like “Man rock sit” could take on the meaning of “The man is at/on the rock”. Because of our word order this means we have postpositions
## Possession
Every possessive phrase has a possessor and a possessee. In “The man’s dog” the man is the possessor, indicated by both its position and the ‘’s’ and the dog is the possessee. The order of the possessor and the possessee is almost always the same as the adjective and the noun. Our adjectives come before our nouns, and so our possessor will come before our possessee.
