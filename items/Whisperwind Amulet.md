The Whisperwind Amulet is a legendary item that can be worn as an amulet

## Features
* **Spell Slot Augmentation**:

This amulet grants an attuned Arcane Trickster Rogue an additional spell slot of each level they can cast, except for the highest one they have access to(e.g. one extra 1st level, 2nd level, 3rd level, 4th level if they have access to 5th level spells)

* **Shadow Ward**:

The amulet creates a 25 ft radius protective aura centered on the wearer. This aura provides resistance against the effects from high level magic (7th, 8th and 9th level spells).
Allies in this aura have advantage on saving throws against high level magic spells

* **Whispers of the Ancient**:

Once week the amulet allow for the wearer to cast Legend Lore even if they don't know the spell. The casting of this spell will often reveal secret information about the origins of the amulet, the Whisperwind family, powerful magic or powerful magical creatures

 * **Shadow of Hope**:

The amulet allows the wearer to cast Beacon of Hope once per long rest without expending a spell slot, even if the wearer does not know the spell
