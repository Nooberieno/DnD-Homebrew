Twinblades are count as a valid weapon for the Poleam Master feat  

Two-handing a twinblade when you are proficient allows for two-weapon fighting, meaning you could make a second attack on your bonus action as if you were holding two weapons 
When wielding the twinblade in two-hands and using two-weapon fighting, you make both attacks as 1d8 damage rolls instead of the 1d10 versatile damage

A player that has the Dual Wielder feat and is proficient in twinblades can use two-weapon fighting when one-handing a twinblade, they do not get the two-handed damage bonus from versatile  
If they are holding a second weapon, they need to choose with which to make their second attack
