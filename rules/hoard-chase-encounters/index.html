    Hoard Chase Encounters
  </h1>
  <p class="subtitle"><strong></strong></p>
  <p>Did your players piss off 3 goblin settlements in a row, did they upset the population of a city or did they draw the attention of the local guards or army? Whatever the case they are now being chased by a massive amount of creatures. Hoard Chase encounters are a good way to force your players into a specific place without railroading them. Say you want them out of a dungeon, you could have tens or even hundreds of monsters appear from the behind the walls that they suddenly need to escape from, but how does that work?</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-hoard-chase">Creating a Hoard Chase</h2>
<p>Hoard Chases only really work well in an area with 1 or more straightforward paths to follow, like a cityscape with lots of streets or a dungeon with a large corridor. A hoard encounter doesn't make much sense and are harder to run in large open areas like a plains.</p>
<h2 id="starting-a-hoard-chase">Starting a Hoard Chase</h2>
<p>Make sure everyone that is not in combat rolls for initiative, including the hoard. The hoard is always treated like a single target. Make sure the hoard is not too close to your players, 10 ft is good distance between the hoard and the players. A hoard chase typically blocks of the place where the hoard came from.</p>
<h2 id="variant-rule-parkour-master">Variant Rule: Parkour Master</h2>
<p>Chase initiative should be different from combat initiative, as it is not about fast hands or quick reflexes, but all about stamina, who can sustain high speeds and quickly overcome physical obstacles. Instead of rolling a dexterity check, roll an Athletics (speed) or Constitution (stamina) check to determine initiative order. Any bonuses to initiative a player has, such as the Alert feat still apply.</p>
<h2 id="running-a-hoard-chase">Running a Hoard Chase</h2>
<p>A hoard is special in that it has no hit points, the chase only ends when the party meets a condition, like escaping. If your hoard is made up of lower Cr. monsters, like goblins, whenever a player deals a significant amount of damage to the hoard, you could say that one or more of the goblin dies, but the hoard rampages on and 2 new goblins appear from the wall to replace their fallen kin. So a hoard has no hp, then whats the use of hitting it? Dealing damage to the hoard slows it down. A hoard starts its first turn with 10 ft of movement and every turn the players fail to damage it, it gains 20 ft of movement. If a hoard has not gained new movement in at least 2 turns, it gains 5 ft of movement. This can be described as the hoard coordinating better or growing larger as time goes on. Should the hoard can try to move onto a square in which a player is standing, that player needs to make a DC 15 Dexterity Saving Throw or be swallowed by the hoard. If the hoard wants to kill the players, the player takes 5d6 points of either, Bludgeoning, Slashing or Piercing damage that counts as magical for the purposes of overcoming resistances and immunities. If the hoard wants to capture the players, the player is grappled and moves when the hoard moves and can break free on a DC 15 Athletics or Acrobatics check. The hoard counts as difficult terrain for the player while they are inside of it. Another player can use the help action to pull an ally out of the hoard, if they are within 5 ft of the player they are trying to help. The player inside the hoard needs to make the DC 15 Dexterity Saving Throw and on success is pulled out of the hoard.</p>
<h3 id="dashing-during-the-chase">Dashing During the Chase</h3>
<p>“During the chase, a participant can freely use the Dash action a number of times equal to 3 + its Constitution modifier. Each additional Dash action it takes during the chase requires the creature to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution check”  <strong>CHECK, not saving throw</strong> “at the end of its turn or gain one level of exhaustion.” (DMG p. 252)</p>
<h3 id="random-complications">Random Complications</h3>
<p>A the end of a players' turn or the hoard's turn a random complication can happen, roll on random complications table (DMG p. 254) to see what happens. A complication does not disappear if it has been overcome, unless it was an instantaneous effect, but a hoard is not hindered by obstacles as they steamroll their way over everything in their path. You may rule that an obstacle is easier to overcome once someone has already done it. Only 1 random complication should happen per round.</p>
<h2 id="ending-the-chase">Ending the Chase</h2>
<p>A hoard chase has a lot less ending conditions, then a regular chase, since a hoard cannot dash or die. A hoard chase is ended when :</p>
<ul>
<li>The hoard has killed or caught all players</li>
<li>The players escape</li>
<li>The players meet a condition of your choice (such as flipping a lever to close a door)</li>
</ul>
