Overview:   
Jimmy, a goblin who met an untimely and brutal end at the hands of a warlock, has returned from the afterlife originally as a vengeful spirit, but now ascended to godhood. Jimmy offers his blessings exclusively to goblins, granting them powerful, but risky abilities to wreak havoc and exact revenge on those who wronged them.

 Jimmy is a god and a [Patron]({{ site.baseurl }}/Jimmy/Patron%20Jimmy) for players playing a goblinoid race. If a player decides to have Jimmy as their Patron and they are not playing as the goblin race, Jimmy curses them, the player gains no benefits from Jimmy and their highest stat becomes equal to their lowest stat. Any warlock spells cast will have a lower change of working so the target of these spells will have advantage on the saving throw and the PC will have disadvantage on the attack roll.
