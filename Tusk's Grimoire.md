Tusk's Grimoire is a spell book that adds various spells. The spells are available to any Wizard capable of understanding Orc or a Sorcerer born of Orc descent

## Lore
This book belonged to the first ever Orc wizard, Tusk. Tusk tried to learn spellcasting from humans, but this proved unsuccessful, so Tusk decided to make his own spells, specialized for Orcs. These spells or Hymns are recorded in this grimoire, but they since they require Hymns in Orc only people that have learned the language or have an innate ability for understanding the Hymns, can effectively use them.
