### Traits
***Body Part.*** The tentaclaw is part of the Quacken, shares its senses, and can’t exist or act independently from it. The tentaclaw acts on the Quacken’s turn, and doesn’t move or take actions unless commanded by the Quacken. A tentaclaw can’t be more than 30 feet away from the Quacken, and if the Quacken moving would result in a tentaclaw being beyond this range, the tentaclaw moves with the Quacken. If a Quacken’s tentaclaw is reduced to 0 hit points, it separates from the Quacken and goes inert. If the Quacken is reduced to 0 hit points, the tentaclaw is reduced to 0 hit points as well.  
***Condition Sharing.*** If the Quacken is blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, incapacitated, petrified, poisoned, or stunned, the tentaclaw gains that condition as well, losing its immunity for the duration.  
***Siege Monster.*** The tentaclaw deals double damage to objects and structures.  

### Actions
***Slam.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. Hit: 2d6 + 4 bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 17). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained.  
***Fling.*** One Large or smaller object held or creature grappled by the Quacken is thrown up to 60 feet in a random direction and knocked prone. If a thrown target strikes a solid surface, the target takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked prone.
