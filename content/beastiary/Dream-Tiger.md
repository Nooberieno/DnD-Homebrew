___
***Dream Stalker.*** The Dream Tiger can enter the dreams of creatures within 1 mile of it. If a creature is sleeping, the Dream Tiger can cast *Phantasmal Force* (save DC 15) without expending a spell slot. The illusion created by this effect can deal psychic damage as if it were real. A creature affected by this ability wakes up if it takes damage from the illusion.  
***Nightmare Predator.*** When the Dream Tiger reduces a creature to 0 hit points in a dream, the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 14 (4d6) psychic damage and wake up with one level of exhaustion.  
***Ethereal Form.*** The Dream Tiger can move through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.  

### Actions
***Multi-attack.*** The Dream Tiger makes two attacks: one with its Claws and one with its Bite.  
***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d10 + 4) piercing damage.  
***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (3d8 + 4) slashing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the end of its next turn.  
***Dream Scream (Recharge 5-6).*** The Dream Tiger releases a psychic roar. Each creature of the Dream Tiger’s choice within 30 feet must make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 27 (6d8) psychic damage and is stunned until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t stunned.  

### Bonus Actions
***Phase Shift.*** The Dream Tiger teleports up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.  

### Reactions
***Dream Evasion.*** When the Dream Tiger is hit by an attack, it can halve the damage against it and teleport up to 15 feet to an unoccupied space.  

### Legendary Actions
***Nightmare Swipe.*** The Dream Tiger makes one Claws attack.  
***Ethereal Charge (Costs 2 Actions).*** The Dream Tiger moves up to its flying speed without provoking opportunity attacks.  
***Dream Manifestation (Costs 3 Actions).*** The Dream Tiger summons a phantasmal duplicate of itself in a space it can see within 30 feet. The duplicate lasts until the end of the Dream Tiger’s next turn. It has the same statistics as the Dream Tiger but can’t use legendary actions. The duplicate vanishes if it takes damage.
