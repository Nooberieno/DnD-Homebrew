___
***Transfigured.*** The Transfigured Humanoid has disadvantage on checks to prevent itself being transfigured again by its creator, and it will defend itself in combat if attacked.  
***Tortured Existence.*** The Transfigured Humanoid lives a life of constant agony, always in a haze of pain and confusion, half remembering who it was as its creator forces it to act against its will. Additionally, the Transfigured Humanoid does not heal on its own.  
***Unstable Flesh.*** The Transfigured Humanoid can grow and absorb its flesh as needed to protect itself or its creator. Twice a day the Transfigured Humanoid can alter its flesh, either gaining +2 AC as a reaction, increasing its reach with slam by 5 ft, or increasing the damage from slam by +3. This effect is lost when the Transfigured Humanoid's turn ends as its fatigued flesh returns to normal.  

### Actions
***Dual Slam.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 1d6 + 3 bludgeoning damage. This action hits twice, either attacking one target twice or attacking two different targets. This action may push targets up to 15 ft. from their current position, this does not provoke attack of opportunity.
