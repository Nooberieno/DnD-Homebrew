Scarlet Rot is a magical disease that progressively decays any living matter.

## Effects of Scarlet Rot
A creature affected by Scarlet Rot has disadvantage on Charisma checks and vulnerability to all damage. Additionally, an affected creature has the [Rotting](@/conditions-and-diseases/conditions/Rotting.md) condition, even if their biology normally makes them immune to the condition.

## Ending Scarlet Rot
Scarlet Rot can be ended by a Lessor Restoration. This does not end the [Rotting](@/conditions-and-diseases/conditions/Rotting.md) condition affecting the creature. 
A Greater Restoration cures both the disease and the condition.
