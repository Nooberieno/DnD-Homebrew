**Description**


> _When they make your blood boil, carbonate theirs_



You target a creature within range and attempt to infuse the substance of transport in their body with prickling carbonated bubbles. The target must succeed on a Constitution Saving throw  or take 1d8 piercing damage and gain 1 [[Bleeding|Bleeding Stack]] as its now carbonated blood expands and rupture their vessels. On a successful save the target takes half damage and does not gain a [[Bleeding|Bleeding Stack]]
