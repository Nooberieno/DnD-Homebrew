**Description**

By speaking out loud you force creatures to obey your very desires. The most common use of this spell is to get enemies to follow basic commands. For example: Choose up to three creatures within range that can hear you. The creatures do not need to share a language with you and a creature will obey even directly harmful attacks, if the spell lands. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by one of the following commands (your choice):

- **"Stop"**: The creature is paralyzed until the end of its next turn.
- **"Flee"**: The creature must use its movement to move away from you by the safest available route on each of its turns until it is at least 60 feet away from you.
- **"Attack"**: The creature must use its action to attack a creature of your choice within its range.
- **"Sleep"**: The creature falls unconscious until the end of its next turn. It awakens if it takes damage or someone uses an action to shake or slap it awake.

You might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your command to the DM as precisely as possible. The DM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the more powerful the command, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the command, or the command will backfire dealing psychic damage to you.

_At Higher Levels_: if you use a 9th level spell slot to cast this spell the duration of the effects of basic commands increases by two turns (a creature now sleeps 3 rounds until waking up at the end of the 3rd round) or if you use a more daring command the likelihood of succeeding will increase.
