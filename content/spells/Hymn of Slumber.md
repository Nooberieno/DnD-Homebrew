**Description**

You weave the soothing Hymn of Slumber, casting a sleep-inducing aura around a target you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or fall asleep for the duration, becoming unconscious. Any sudden loud noise or jostling of the target awakens them from this magically induced slumber.
