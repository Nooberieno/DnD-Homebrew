**Description**




You make creatures unable to remember words, causing word heavy spells to falter. Choose a creature within 30 ft that is casting a spell with a verbal component and a description of 100 words or more. You have to make an Arcana check of DC 10 + the level of the spell slot the creature is using to cast the spell. On a success the creature is no longer able to meet the verbal requirement for the spell and the spell fails. On failure your spell slot is consumed and nothing happens. This spell does not work on 8th or 9th level spells, as the magic used for these is too powerful and the words for them are etched into a creature's mind.
