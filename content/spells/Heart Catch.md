**Description**


You create a floating, spectral hand that can grab and manipulate a creature at a distance. Choose a creature within range. The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained by the spectral hand. While restrained, you can use your action on subsequent turns to perform one of the following actions:



- **Throw**: You can throw the restrained creature up to 30 feet in any direction, dealing 3d8 bludgeoning damage if it collides with a solid surface or another creature. The thrown creature and any creature it collides with must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.

- **Crush**: You can crush the restrained creature, dealing 4d8 force damage. The creature remains restrained as long as you concentrate on the spell, up to the duration.



The restrained creature can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, the creature frees itself and the spell ends.
