**Casting Time**: 1 action  
**Range**: 60 ft  
**Components**: S(a clap from the soul)  
**Duration**: Instantaneous

**Description**


You clap your hands together, which swaps to objects in space. Choose two targets you can see within range. These targets can be creatures, objects, or a combination of both. If the chosen targets are willing, they instantly switch places. Unwilling targets must make a Charisma saving throw to resist the effect. On a successful save, the spell has no effect on that target.



_At Higher Levels_: When casting with a 6th level spell slot or higher you gain 10 ft of range for every level above 5th
