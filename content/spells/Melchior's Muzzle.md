**Description**


You target a creature size Large or smaller within range that has a mouth or other orifices used for communication. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or its mouth and/or other orifices used for verbal communication meld shut for the duration of the spell. While its mouth is sealed the target can't speak(telepathic communication is not hindered by this spell), cast spells with verbal components or use its bite attack if it has one. Additionally the target cannot breathe through its mouth, which might cause suffocation if it has no other means of breathing. If the target has swallowed something, it cannot release it while this spell lasts. While the effect lasts the target or another creature can use a slashing or natural weapon to part the flesh. Doing so results in the target taking slashing damage equal to two rolls of the weapons damage die, and the effect of this spell ends. Alternatively if the target has a breath weapon it can use it to force its mouth open, taking half the damage the breath weapon would deal normally and ending the effect.
