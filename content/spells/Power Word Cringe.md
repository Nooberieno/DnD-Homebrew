**Description**




You speak loaded with acute embarrassment, forcing a creature within range to cringe. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or suffer 4d6 psychic damage as it reels from discomfort. On a successful save, the target takes half damage.



If the saving throw is failed by 5 or more the target gains vulnerability to psychic damage and disadvantage on Charisma until the end of the next turn.



If the saving throw is failed by 10 or more the creature must make another saving throw at the start of its next turn. On a failed save, the creature is paralyzed for that turn, frozen by sheer awkwardness. On a successful save the creature takes an additional  2d6 psychic damage.
