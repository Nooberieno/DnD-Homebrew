**Description**

You chant an ancient Orcish hymn, creating a protective magic circle that shields yourself and allies from harmful spells. the hymn creates a shimmering magic circle that extends in a 15 ft radius around you. While chanting, you maintain concentration to sustain the protective effect.
- **Spell Protection**: For the duration, any creature within the aura (including you) gains advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects
- **Spell Resistance**: In addition, any time a creature within the aura takes damage caused by a spell, the damage is reduced by an amount equal to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of 1). This effect applies to each instance of spell damage, not just once per turn.
- **Dispel or Counter:** If a creature within the aura is the target of a spell that would be negated or diminished by spells like _Dispel Magic_ or _Counterspell_, they gain a +2 bonus to the roll to counter or dispel the spell.
- **Visibility and Movement:** The aura is visible as a faint shimmering dome. Creatures can move freely through the aura without disrupting it, but the aura remains centered on you.
