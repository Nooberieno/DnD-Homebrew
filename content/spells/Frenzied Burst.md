**Description**


You release a concentrated burst of yellow flame from your eyes towards an enemy in range within your line of sight. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d10 damage on a failed save and half as much on a successful one. Additionally you can spend an action charging the burst, adding additional heat and intensity to the flame. When charged the burst now deals 5d10 damage on a failed save and ignores resistance to fire damage, however you are knocked prone from the backlash
