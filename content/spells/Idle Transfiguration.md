*Level 3 Transmutation Spell*  
**Casting Time**: 1 action  
**Range**: Touch  
**Components**: V, S  
**Duration**: Instantaneous  
**Classes**: Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard  

**Description**


You reach out and touch a target creature of Large, Medium or Small size, attempting to alter or disfigure their soul and thus their body. The target must succeed on a Constitution Saving throw of DC 6 + spellcasting modifier + proficiency or take  4d8 necrotic damage, taking half as much on a successful save. If the target is under 6% HP and fails the save, they are transmuted into a [Transfigured Humanoid](Transfigured%20Humanoid.md) which you may command.



_At Higher Levels_: When this spell is cast using a spell slot of 4th or higher the DC increases by 1. For every 2 levels(5th, 7th and 9th level), the HP requirement for making the target a Transfigured Human increases by 2%
