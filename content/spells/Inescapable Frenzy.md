**Description**


You catch your target in a grapple as yellow flames gush forward from your eyes. The target is considered grappled for the duration of the spell. The target takes 3d8 fire damage immediately and at the start of each of their turns, you take half that damage. The target can attempt to exit the grapple with an Athletics or Acrobatics check, if they fail they take an additional 4d6 fire damage, if they succeed the grapple ends and they take half of the damage.
