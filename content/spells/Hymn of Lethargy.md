**Description**


Through the draining Hymn of Lethargy, you cast a languid aura around a target within range, sapping their energy and slowing their movements. The target's speed is halved, and they have disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws for the duration of the spell. The target feels a weight upon them, making every action more arduous and taxing. At the start of each turn during the duration the target needs to make a wisdom saving throw of DC 13, if they fail they take 1d4 Psychic damage.
