**Description**


By touching your thumb to your index finger, you create a magical lens through which your vision sharpens and extends. You can see up to 1 mile away with perfect clarity, discerning fine details as though observing something no more than a 100 ft from you

- **5th level**: By forming the lens with your thumb and middle finger you create a darkvision effect. You can see in non-magical darkness through the lens to a distance of 120 ft
- **11th level** By forming the lens with your thumb and ring finger you create a blindsight effect. You can see through the lens as if you had blindsight to a distance of 60 ft
- **17th level** By forming the lens with your thumb and pinky and expending a 4th level spell slot you create a truesight effect. You gain 60 ft of truesight as long as the lens is stable, this effect disappears as soon as your thumb is no longer touching your pinky or your concentration drops.
