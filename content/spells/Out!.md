**Description**


> *This place called, it wants you to leave*



You invoke a ward of ownership, marking a creature as unwelcome within a location you control. As part of casting this spell, you must specify a structure or bounded location you own or have rightful authority over(such as a home, shop, temple, or a small piece of land no larger than 10.000 square feet). You must currently be within this location to cast this spell. Choose a humanoid within range. The creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be teleported to the nearest safe unoccupied space at least 30 ft outside the boundaries of the specified location. For the duration the creature is unable to re-enter the location by any means, including teleportation, planar travel or physical movement
