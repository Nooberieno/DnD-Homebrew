**Description**


> *You dick i needed those*



You target one creature within range, causing their bones to become rubbery and flexible. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, their movement speed is halved, and they have disadvantage on Dexterity checks and all ability checks. However, they will take half damage from weapon attacks, as their limbs can bend unnaturally upon impact.



*At Higher Levels.* When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 5th
