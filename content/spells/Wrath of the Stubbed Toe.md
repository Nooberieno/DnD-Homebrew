**Description**

You point at a creature within range, causing an invisible force to slam against the target's foot, mimicking the sensation of a severe stubbed toe. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 4d6 force damage and be knocked prone, as they reel from the unexpected pain. On a successful save, the target takes half damage and isn't knocked prone.

*At Higher Levels.* When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.
