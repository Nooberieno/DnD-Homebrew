**Description**


You ignite yourself with an immense, fiery explosion that deals devastating damage to all creatures around you, including yourself. When this spell occurs you take 90% of your max health as fire damage. This spell ignores resistance to fire damage or magic and treats immunity to fire damage or magic as resistance.
Except creatures within 10 ft of you, all creatures within 150 ft of you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, taking  10d10 fire damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one. Additionally creatures take extra damage based on their proximity to you i.e. how close they are to you

- Within 90 ft, an additional 25 fire damage
- Within 45 ft, an additional 50 fire damage
- Within 20 ft, an additional 75 fire damage

Creatures within 10 ft of you do not roll the saving throw and take  100 + 10d10 fire damage. A creature that takes 100 fire damage or more from this spell is Blinded until a Greater Restoration or Heal spell is cast to restore its vision. Additionally, a creature reduced to 0 hp by this spell is turned to ashes and may only be brought back by a Wish or True Resurrection spell.
After this spell's effect takes place, you can only heal up to 50% of your max hp and cannot cast any high level magic (7th, 8th and 9th level spells). These drawbacks are not permanent and revert after you complete a long rest.
