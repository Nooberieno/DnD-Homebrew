**Description**


You create a minefield of sharp, blocky shapes resembling Lego bricks in a 20-foot radius on the ground within range. When a creature enters the minefield for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 4d6 piercing damage and falls prone on a failed save, or half as much damage and doesn't fall prone on a successful one. The area becomes difficult terrain for the duration.



At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.
