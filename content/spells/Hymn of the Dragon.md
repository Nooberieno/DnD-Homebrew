You clutch a dragon scale between your hands, as you chant an ancient Orcish hymn you call upon the might of dragons, releasing a devastating burst of energy. The energy takes the form of a dragon's skeleton which crashes into the ground, Hymn of the Dragon engulfs all within its reach be they friend or foe. The energy alters color and secondary effect based on the dragon scale that was clutched between your hands.



	* **Acid**(Black or Copper Dragon Scale): The area becomes coated in acidic residue, dealing an additional 2d8 acid damage to any creature that starts its turn in the area for the next minute.

	* **Lightning**(Blue or Bronze Dragon Scale): The air crackles with residual energy, causing creatures that fail their saving throw to be stunned until the start of your next turn.

	* **Fire**(Red or Brass Dragon Scale): The ground scorches with lingering flames, creating an area of difficult terrain that deals 2d6 fire damage to any creature that moves through it for the next minute.

	* **Poison**(Green Dragon Scale): A toxic cloud lingers, causing creatures that fail their saving throw to be poisoned for 1 minute. They can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns, ending the condition on a success.
