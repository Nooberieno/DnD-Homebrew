**Description**


You conjure a shimmering, translucent box of magical cards at a point within range. The box is a cube, 5 feet on a side, and hovers in the air. When a spell passes through the cube, the spell surges with illusory power.

- If the spell deals damage, increase the damage by **1d4 per spell level** (cantrips gain +1d4).
- Only one spell per turn can benefit from the box.
- The box is intangible, and spells can pass through it without obstruction.

*At Higher Levels.* When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the cube’s size increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 2nd.
