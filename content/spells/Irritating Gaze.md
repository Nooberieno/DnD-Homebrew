**Description**




You project a field of illusory particles directly into the eyes of a creature within range. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is irritated and distracted by the particles. Until the effect ends, the target has disadvantaged attack rolls, and ability checks that require sight. Additionally, the creature's movement speed is halved as it repeatedly rubs its eyes to rid itself of the particles.



At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the effect ends. The same is true if the target takes damage. When casting this spell using a 4th-level spell slot or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 3rd.
