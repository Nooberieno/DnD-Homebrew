**Description**


You summon a magic circle in your hand, unleashing a torrent of flames in a 30-foot line originating from you. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. As an action on each of your turns for the duration, you can direct the flames at a target within the range of the line, requiring them to make the saving throw for damage. The damage increases by 1d6 for each level above 6th. If a creature starts its turn within the line, it takes the spell's full damage automatically. 



*At Higher Levels.* If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 6th.
