**Description**


You attempt to magically alter the very fabric of a creature's groin area, twisting and manipulating them into submission. Choose one target you can see within range. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, their nether regions are twisted and contorted, causing extreme excruciating pain. The target is considered restrained and unable to take any actions during the duration of the spell. Additionally, the target takes 3d12 force damage at the start of each of their turns while under the effect of the spell. The target can repeat the Constitution saving throw at the end of each of their turns to end the effect. If the target does not have testicles, the saving throw automatically succeeds.



_At Higher Levels._ When you cast this spell using a 7th-level spell slot or higher, the force damage increases by  1d12 for each slot level above 6th.
