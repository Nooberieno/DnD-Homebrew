**Description**


You snap your deck into the air, creating a dazzling spectacle of colored projectiles that streak toward your enemies. Choose up to five targets within range (you can direct multiple projectiles at one target). Each target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take damage.

Roll 1d6 for each projectile to determine its damage type:

1. Red, **Fire**
2. Blue, **Cold**
3. Green, **Poison**
4. Yellow, **Lightning**
5. Purple, **Psychic**
6. White, **Radiant**

Each projectile deals **1d8 damage** of its rolled type. A target hit by multiple projectiles rolls separately for each saving throw.

*At Higher Levels.* When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you create one additional projectile for each slot level above 3rd.
