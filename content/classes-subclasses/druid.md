## Subclasses

{{subclass_button(subclass="Circle of the Tides Druid")}} 


## Class Features

### Druidic
You know Druidic, the secret language of druids. You can speak the language and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who know this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message's presence with a successful 15 Wisdom (Perception) check but can't decipher it without magic.

### Spellcasting
Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to shape that essence to your will. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the <a href="https://2014.5e.tools/spells.html#blankhash,flstclass:druid=1">druid spell list</a>.

#### Cantrips
 At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the <a href="https://2014.5e.tools/spells.html#blankhash,flstlevel:0=1,flstclass:druid=1">druid spell list</a>. You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table.

#### Preparing and Casting Spells
 The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your <a href="https://2014.5e.tools/spells.html#blankhash,flstclass:druid=1">druid spells</a> of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.

You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

#### Spellcasting Ability
 Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

&nbsp;&nbsp;**Spell save DC** = 8 + wis + Proficiency Bonus

&nbsp;&nbsp;**Spell attack modifier** = wis + Proficiency Bonus

#### Ritual Casting
 You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.

#### Spellcasting Focus
 You can use a <a href="https://2014.5e.tools/items.html#druidic focus_phb">druidic focus</a> as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells.

### Wild Shape
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or lower that doesn't have a flying or swimming speed.

| Level | Max. CR | Limitations | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2nd | <a href="https://2014.5e.tools/bestiary.html#blankhash,flstchallenge rating:min=&0~max=&1/4,flsttype:beast=1,flstspeed type:fly~swim=2,flstmiscellaneous:swarm=2">1/4</a> | No flying or swimming speed | Wolf |
| 4th | <a href="https://2014.5e.tools/bestiary.html#blankhash,flstchallenge rating:min=&0~max=&1/2,flsttype:beast=1,flstspeed type:fly=2,flstmiscellaneous:swarm=2">1/2</a> | No flying speed | Crocodile |
| 8th | <a href="https://2014.5e.tools/bestiary.html#blankhash,flstchallenge rating:min=&0~max=&1,flsttype:beast=1,flstmiscellaneous:swarm=2">1</a> | — | Giant eagle |

You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.

While you are transformed, the following rules apply:

- Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.
- When you transform, you assume the beast's hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked unconscious.
- You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that you've already cast.
- You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.
- You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.

### Wild Companion
_2nd-level druid <a href="https://2014.5e.tools/variantrules.html#optional%20class%20features_tce">optional feature</a>_

You gain the ability to summon a spirit that assumes an animal form: as an action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to cast the find familiar spell, without material components.

When you cast the spell in this way, the familiar is a fey instead of a beast, and the familiar disappears after a number of hours equal to half your druid level.

### Druid Circle
At 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids from the list of available circles. Your choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

{% subclass_feature(subclass="Circle of the Tides Druid") %}
### Circle of the Tides Druid
> Circle of the Tides Druids are fierce guardians of the sea and all that live inside of it. Their order gathers in the ocean to share news and trade warnings. It is said that 5 of these druids together can cause a hurricane.


### Circle Spells
_2th-level Circle of the Tides Druid feature_

At 2nd level, your connection to the ocean grants you access to certain spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels listed in the Circle of the Tides Spells table. Once you gain access to a Circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain a spell that doesn’t appear on the druid spell list, it is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

| Druid Level | Spells |
|---|---|
| 2nd | _Healing Word_, _Fog Cloud_ |
| 3rd | _Misty Step_, _Prayer of Healing_ |
| 5th | _Tidal Wave_, _Wall of Water_, _Mass Healing Word_ |
| 7th | _Control Water_, _Watery Sphere_ |
| 9th | _Maelstrom_, _Cone of Cold_ |


### Oceanic Blessing
_2th-level Circle of the Tides Druid feature_

You use Wild Shape to transform into creatures that have a swimming speed at 2nd and 3rd level. Additionally you can breath in water and have a swimming speed equal to your walking speed while not wearing heavy armor.


### Ocean's Embrace
_2th-level Circle of the Tides Druid feature_

Starting at 2nd level, you gain the ability to call upon the power of the tides to protect yourself or others. As a bonus action, you can surround yourself or a creature you can see within 30 feet with a swirling barrier of water for 1 minute. The barrier grants the following effects:

- The target gains temporary hit points equal to your druid level + your Wisdom modifier.
- The target’s movement speed decreases by 10 feet.
- The target has resistance to fire damage.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

- The target gains temporary hit points equal to your druid level + your Wisdom modifier.
- The target’s movement speed decreases by 10 feet.
- The target has resistance to fire damage.

{% end %}

### Wild Shape Improvement
At 4th level, your Wild Shape improves as shown on the Beast Shapes table.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

If your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a <a href="https://2014.5e.tools/feats.html">feat</a>.

### Cantrip Versatility
_4th-level druid <a href="https://2014.5e.tools/variantrules.html#optional%20class%20features_tce">optional feature</a>_

Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can replace one cantrip you learned from this class's Spellcasting feature with another cantrip from the <a href="https://2014.5e.tools/spells.html#blankhash,flstlevel:0=1,flstclass:Druid=1">druid spell list</a>.

### Druid Circle feature
At 6th level, you gain a feature granted by your Druid Circle.

{% subclass_feature(subclass="Circle of the Tides Druid") %}
### Tidal Mastery
_6th-level Circle of the Tides Druid feature_

At 6th level, you can command the tides to aid your allies or hinder your foes. When you cast a spell that creates or manipulates water, such as _Tidal Wave_ or _Control Water_, you can choose one of the following additional effects:

- Surging Tide: You can push creatures within the affected area up to 10 feet in a direction of your choice.
- Rejuvenating Waters: Allies within the affected area regain hit points equal to your druid level.

{% end %}

### Druid Circle feature
At 10th level, you gain a feature granted by your Druid Circle feature.

{% subclass_feature(subclass="Circle of the Tides Druid") %}
### Tidal Aura
_10th-level Circle of the Tides Druid feature_

As a bonus action, you can expend a use of Wild Shape to exude a mystical watery force in a 30 ft radius. Creatures of your choice within this Aura treat it as difficult terrain. If a creature has a swimming speed it ignores this effect. Your Tidal Aura also enhances your healing powers. When you cast a spell that restores hit points to a creature within this Tidal Aura, all allied creatures within the Aura regains additional hit points equal to Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1) + your druid level. your Tidal Aura lasts for 1 minute. Its effects end early  if you end it as a bonus action, or if you are incapacitated.

{% end %}

### Waters of Life
_14th-level Circle of the Tides Druid feature_

You can activate Tidal Aura without expending a use of Wild Shape. Once activating Tidal Aura this way, you cannot do so again until you have completed a long rest. Creatures of your choice treat the area your Tidal Aura is occupying as difficult terrain if they have a swimming speed.  Tidal Aura now gives temporary hit points equal to your druid level to creatures of your choice on the beginning of each of their turns if they start their turn in the Tidal Aura. Allied creatures in your Tidal Aura reduce fire damage by an amount equal to your druid level.
