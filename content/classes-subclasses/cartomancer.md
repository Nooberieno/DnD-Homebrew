## Class Features

### Card Recovery
You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your Deck of Cards. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your cartomancer level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.

For example, if you're a 4th-level cartomancer, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.

### Spellcasting
Your skill and prowess with cards and the arcane cards you posses are the source of your spells.

#### Cantrips
 At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cartomancer spell list. You learn additional cartomancer cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the cartomancer table.

#### Spell Slots
 The cartomancer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your cartomancer spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these cartomancer spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

#### Spells Known of 1st level or higher
 You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the cartomancer spell list.

You learn an additional cartomancer spell of your choice at each level except 12th, 14th, 16th, 18th, 19th, and 20th. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the cartomancer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the cartomancer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

#### Spellcasting ability
 Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your cartomancer spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cartomancer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

&nbsp;&nbsp;**Spell save DC** = 8 + int + Proficiency Bonus

&nbsp;&nbsp;**Spell attack modifier** = int + Proficiency Bonus

#### Ritual Casting
 You can cast any cartomancer spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag

### Deck of Cards
Choose your arcane deck of cards, which describe the deck you possess, from the list of available decks.

Your choice grants you features when you choose it at 1st level and again at 6th, 14th and 18th level.

Your deck of cards is the heart of your magic and is where you store your spells. Should this deck be destroyed you lose the ability to access all spells and features grant by your deck, except cantrips which are fixed in your mind.  If you can find a deck with the same symbols and number of cards, you can spend 1 hour to turn it your deck.

{% subclass_feature(subclass="Tarot Deck") %}
### Tarot Deck
_"Each card carries a story, a secret, a truth waiting to be unveiled. Through the Tarot, you glimpse the weave of fate — and bend it to your will."_

Tarot Deck Cartomancers are seers and fate-weavers, drawing power from prophecy and symbolism. Unlike the trickery of Jokers or the sharp odds of Poker, Tarot focuses on foresight, destiny, and manipulating probability in subtle but devastating ways.

This deck contains 78 cards: 56 Minor Arcana split evenly into 4 suits (Cups, Pentacles, Wands and Swords) and 22 Major Arcana

_Note: If you have an actual Tarot Deck with 22 Major Arcana cards, you can draw a card from it for the Arcana's Whisper(Major) instead of rolling dice._


### Deck Spells
_1st-level Tarot Deck feature_

Your deck infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th and 9th level you gain access to spells connected to your deck.

Once you gain access to a deck spell, you will always know it and it does not count against the number of spells you can know. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the cartomancer spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cartomancer spell for you.

| Cartomancer Level | Deck Spells |
|---|---|
| 3rd | Detect Magic, Detect Poison and Disease |
| 5th | Augury, Zone of Truth |
| 7th | Clairvoyance, Protection from Energy |
| 9th | Arcane Eye, Aura of Purity |


### Arcana's Whisper (Minor)
_1st-level Tarot Deck feature_

You can draw from the four suits of the Minor Arcana to subtly twist fate.

As a bonus action, choose one of the four suits and expend 1 Deal to invoke its effect.

| Suit | Effect |
|---|---|
| **Cups** | A creature you choose within 30 ft regains hit points equal to 1d4 + your Intelligence modifier. (Healing grows to 2d4 at 5th level, 3d4 at 11th, 4d4 at 17th.) |
| **Pentacles** | You or an ally within 30 ft gains +2 AC until the start of your next turn. |
| **Wands** | One creature of your choice within 30 ft gains a bonus equal to 1d4 on its next attack roll or saving throw before the start of your next turn. |
| **Swords** | Choose one creature within 30 ft. Until the start of your next turn, that creature has disadvantage on its next attack roll. |

{% end %}

{% subclass_feature(subclass="Poker Deck") %}
### Poker Deck
_"A card shark’s patience, a gambler’s nerve. You don’t play every hand—but when you do, it’s the one that ends the game."_

The Poker Deck Cartomancer relies on reading the table (and the battlefield), calculating odds, and then betting everything on the perfect play. You stack subtle advantages until the moment is right for the big reveal.

This deck contains 52 cards: 13 clubs, 13 spades, 13 diamonds and 13 hearts.

{% end %}

{% subclass_feature(subclass="Joker Deck") %}
### Joker Deck
_"You don’t play by the rules—you make them up as you go. Every shuffle is a chance, every deal a gamble. And no one’s better at stacking the odds than you."_

The Joker Deck Cartomancer thrives in uncertainty, turning chaos into opportunity. This subclass’s magic is whimsical, disruptive, and dangerously unpredictable for enemies (and sometimes allies).

This deck is made up of 54 cards: 13 clubs, 13 spades, 13 diamonds, 13 hearts and 2 jokers, which are your signature card.


### Deck Spells

| 7th | Clairvoyance, Protection from Energy |
| 9th | Arcane Eye, Aura of Purity |


### Buffoon
_1st-level Joker Deck feature_

You are not a clown, you are the entire circus and you play your role perfectly. After all, who expects the fool to trick _them_.

- You gain proficiency in Performance. If you already have it, gain proficiency in Sleight of Hand instead.
- Whenever you use Card Charisma, you can add your Intelligence modifier twice instead of once.
- Whenever you successfully distract or entertain a creature with roleplay or illusion magic, you can impose disadvantage on its next attack roll against you or an ally within 10 feet.

{% end %}

{% subclass_feature(subclass="Zener Deck") %}
### Zener Deck
_"Symbols repeat, patterns emerge, and thought bleeds into reality. You’ve pierced the veil between mind and matter — and the cards are your instruments of proof."_

The Zener Deck Cartomancer channels psychic phenomena through their symbolic deck. They are perceptive seers, mental duelists, and wielders of predictive probability.

- You can make a Wisdom (Insight) check contested by a creature’s Charisma (Deception) to determine if it is hiding its thoughts or alignment of intent (hostile, neutral, friendly).

{% end %}

_Cost: 1 Deal_

When you cast a spell, you can expend 1 Deal to cast it without verbal or somatic components

- Stack the Deck:

_Cost: 5 Deals_

When you cast a spell that forces one or more creatures to make a saving throw, you can spend 5 Deals to force one creature that succeeded on its first saving throw against that spell to reroll it. The creature must use the new result.

- Discard:

_Cost: 2 Deals_

When you make a spell attack roll for a spell and miss, you can spend 2 Deals to reroll the d20 and you must use the new roll.

- Lucky Card

_Cost: 1-2 Deals_

When you make an ability check, you can spend 1 Deal to add a d4 to the result (after seeing the roll, but before knowing if it succeeds). You can spend 2 Deals instead to roll a d6 instead of a d4.

- Sticky Fingers

- Stock and Draw:

_Cost: 1-9 Deals_

You can store a spell from the cartomancer spell list in a card by spending Deals equal to the spell’s level (1 Deal for a cantrip).   
The stored spell must have a casting time of 1 action.  
Only you can release the stored spell.   
To store it (Stock), you must be able to perform the spell's components.   
To release it (Draw), you must either touch the card or provide a verbal component while within 10 ft of the card.   
Once released, the spell behaves exactly as if it were just cast by you.   
While storing a spell in this way you cannot cast it normally without using Draw and only 1 spell can be stored this way at a time.   
Using Stock again causes the previous card to lose its magic.   
An unused spell fades from the card after a long rest.  

**Deals**  
You have 3 Deals, and you gain one additional point every time you level up, to a maximum of 20 at level 20.  
You can never have more Deals than shown on the table for your level.  
You regain all spent Deals when you finish a long rest.

### The Cards Will Tell
_6th-level Tarot Deck feature_

When you finish a long rest, you may spend 10 minutes laying out three cards from your Tarot deck in a ritual of foresight. As you complete the reading, you glimpse fragments of a possible future.

The DM provides you with a vision, omen, or symbolic impression and the three cards that symbolize these events. The message may be cryptic or clear, literal or metaphorical, at the DM’s discretion. You do not know exactly **when** or **how** the vision will come to pass — only that it is tied to events in the near future.

- The vision might reveal danger (“a blade in the dark”), an opportunity (“a crown toppled”), or insight about a specific creature, object, or location (“the tower burns”).
- The DM decides the content, clarity, and timing of the vision.
- You may choose to focus your reading on a **specific creature** you have met, even without their knowledge. In that case, the vision relates to that creature’s fate.
