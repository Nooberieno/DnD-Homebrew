## Subclasses
{{subclass_button(subclass="Joker Deck")}} 


## Class Features

### Card Recovery
You have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your Deck of Cards. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your cartomancer level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.

For example, if you're a 4th-level cartomancer, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.

### Spellcasting
Your skill and prowess with cards and the arcane cards you posses are the source of your spells.

#### Cantrips
 At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the cartomancer spell list. You learn additional cartomancer cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the cartomancer table.

#### Spell Slots
 The cartomancer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your cartomancer spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these cartomancer spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

#### Spells Known of 1st level or higher
 You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the cartomancer spell list.

You learn an additional cartomancer spell of your choice at each level except 12th, 14th, 16th, 18th, 19th, and 20th. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the cartomancer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the cartomancer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

#### Spellcasting ability
 Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your cartomancer spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a cartomancer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

&nbsp;&nbsp;**Spell save DC** = 8 + int + Proficiency Bonus

&nbsp;&nbsp;**Spell attack modifier** = int + Proficiency Bonus

#### Ritual Casting
 You can cast any cartomancer spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag

### Deck of Cards
Choose your arcane deck of cards, which describe the deck you possess, from the list of available decks.

Your choice grants you features when you choose it at 1st level and again at 6th, 14th and 18th level.

Your deck of cards is the heart of your magic and is where you store your spells. Should this deck be destroyed you lose the ability to access all spells and features grant by your deck, except cantrips which are fixed in your mind.  If you can find a deck with the same symbols and number of cards, you can spend 1 hour to turn it your deck.

{% subclass_feature(subclass="Joker Deck") %}
### Joker Deck
_"You don’t play by the rules—you make them up as you go. Every shuffle is a chance, every deal a gamble. And no one’s better at stacking the odds than you."_

The Joker Deck Cartomancer thrives in uncertainty, turning chaos into opportunity. This subclass’s magic is whimsical, disruptive, and dangerously unpredictable for enemies (and sometimes allies).

This deck is made up of 54 cards: 13 clubs, 13 spades, 13 diamonds, 13 hearts and 2 jokers, which are your signature card.


### Deck Spells
_1st-level Joker Deck feature_

Your deck infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th and 9th level you gain access to spells connected to your deck.

Once you gain access to a deck spell, you will always know it and it does not count against the number of spells you can know. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the cartomancer spell list, the spell is nonetheless a cartomancer spell for you.

| Cartomancer Level | Deck Spells |
|---|---|
| 3rd | Charm Person, Disguise Self |
| 5th | Crown of Madness, Calm Emotions |
| 7th | Feign Death, Nondetection |
| 9th | Freedom of Movement, Seeming |


### Buffoon
_1st-level Joker Deck feature_

You are not a clown, you are the entire circus and you play your role perfectly. After all, who expects the fool to trick _them_.

- You gain proficiency in Performance. If you already have it, gain proficiency in Sleight of Hand instead.
- Whenever you use Card Charisma, you can add your Intelligence modifier twice instead of once.
- Whenever you successfully distract or entertain a creature with roleplay or illusion magic, you can impose disadvantage on its next attack roll against you or an ally within 10 feet.

{% end %}

### Card Charisma
At 2nd level, you may add your Intelligence modifier whenever you make a Deception or Persuasion check while doing card tricks

### Deck Actions
At 3rd level, you learn to apply your deck in ways other than just casting spells. You gain two of the following Deck Actions of your choice. You gain another one at 10th and 17th level.

- Overstock:

_Cost: 1 Deal_

When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 Deal to reroll a number of damage dice equal to your Intelligence modifier. You must use the new rolls

- Magic Trick:

_Cost: 1 Deal_

When you cast a spell, you can expend 1 Deal to cast it without verbal or somatic components

- Stack the Deck:

_Cost: 5 Deals_

When you cast a spell that forces one or more creatures to make a saving throw, you can spend 5 Deals to force one creature that succeeded on its first saving throw against that spell to reroll it. The creature must use the new result.

- Discard:

_Cost: 2 Deals_

When you make a spell attack roll for a spell and miss, you can spend 2 Deals to reroll the d20 and you must use the new roll.

- Lucky Card

_Cost: 1-2 Deals_

When you make an ability check, you can spend 1 Deal to add a d4 to the result (after seeing the roll, but before knowing if it succeeds). You can spend 2 Deals instead to roll a d6 instead of a d4.

- Sticky Fingers

_Cost: 2 Deal_

When you make a Sleight of Hand or Stealth check, you can spend 2 Deals to gain advantage.

Additionally, if you fail a Sleight of Hand check by 3 or less, you can spend 2 Deal to succeed instead.

- Card Sharp

_Cost: 2 Deals_

When you make a Charisma (Deception, Intimidation, or Persuasion) check, you can spend 2 Deals to treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.

- Shuffle

_Cost: 1 Deal_

When you cast a spell that deals a type of damage from the following list, you can spend 1 Deal to change that damage type to one of the other listed types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, thunder.

- Stock and Draw:

_Cost: 1-9 Deals_

You can store a spell from the cartomancer spell list in a card by spending Deals equal to the spell’s level (1 Deal for a cantrip). The stored spell must have a casting time of 1 action. Only you can release the stored spell. To store it (Stock), you must be able to perform the spell's components. To release it (Draw), you must either touch the card or provide a verbal component while within 10 ft of the card. Once released, the spell behaves exactly as if it were just cast by you. While storing a spell in this way you cannot cast it normally without using Draw and only 1 spell can be stored this way at a time. Using Stock again causes the previous card to lose its magic. An unused spell fades from the card after a long rest.

You have 3 Deals, and you gain one additional point every time you level up, to a maximum of 20 at level 20. You can never have more Deals than shown on the table for your level. You regain all spent Deals when you finish a long rest.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 4th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

If your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a [feat](https://2014.5e.tools/feats.html).

### Dealer's Intuition
When you reach 5th level, you learn to alter your cards in such a way to change their properties. Whenever you take a short or long rest, you can change the Deck Actions you are able to preform. You can't have more Deck Actions then your Cartomancer allows for.

### Deck of Cards Feature
At 6th level, you gain one feature granted by your deck of cards

{% subclass_feature(subclass="Joker Deck") %}
### House Rules
_6th-level Joker Deck feature_

You are the dealer and the table will play by your rules.

Once per turn when you cast a spell that forces a saving throw, you can choose to change the saving throw type (e.g., Dexterity to Wisdom). This choice must be made before the target rolls.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus and you regain all uses upon finishing a long rest.

{% end %}

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 8th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

If your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a [feat](https://2014.5e.tools/feats.html).

### Deck Actions
At 10th level, you learn an additional Deck Action.

### Deck of Cards Feature
At 14th level, you gain one feature granted by your deck of cards

{% subclass_feature(subclass="Joker Deck") %}
### Wild Card
_14th-level Joker Deck feature_

The Wild Card shapes the game, and yours is no different.

As an action roll a d12 and consult the Wild Card Table for the result.

| d12 | Effect |
|---|---|
| 1 | You and all allies within 20 ft teleport up to 30 ft to spaces you can see. |
| 2 | All creatures within 15 ft must make a Strength save or be knocked prone. |
| 3 | The area within 20 ft becomes difficult terrain for 1 minute (illusory debris, grease, etc.). |
| 4 | You gain a +2 bonus to AC until the start of your next turn. |
| 5 | One enemy of your choice must make a Wisdom save or be frightened until end of your next turn. |
| 6 | You instantly regain 2 Deals. |
| 7 | You cast _Mirror Image_ on yourself without using a spell slot. |
| 8 | You get an attack of opportunity against 1 creature of your choice within 5 ft of you |
| 9 | You gain resistance to one damage type of your choice, excluding force, until the start of your next turn. |
| 10 | All enemies within 15 ft must make a Constitution save or be blinded until the start of your next turn. |
| 11 | You or an ally of your choice regains hit points equal to 3d8 + your Intelligence modifier. |
| 12 | You cast _Misty Step_ as part of this action without using a spell slot. |

You can use this feature once per long rest.

{% end %}

### Ability Score Improvement

- You can use Wild Card 4 times per long rest.
- When you or a creature you can see within 30 feet makes an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can use your reaction to force them to reroll the die. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1) and regain all uses upon finishing a long rest.

### Ability Score Improvement
When you reach 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

If your DM allows the use of feats, you may instead take a [feat](https://2014.5e.tools/feats.html).

### Trump Card
If you roll initiative with no Deals, you regain 4.
