_Woundrous Item, Rare_

These scarlet boluses are made from cave moss infected by Scarlet Rot. When activated, a bolus absorbs Scarlet Rot, halting corruption by the disease.  

A creature can cast at least 1 spell or cantrip can activate the bolus by pouring magic into it. When done the bolus radiates a 20 ft area that provides the following benefits to creatures within the aura:
- They cannot contract [Scarlet Rot](@conditions-and-diseases/diseases/Scarlet-Rot.md) or gain the [Rotting](@conditions-and-diseases/conditions/Rotting.md)
- if already afflicted, the disease and condition are suppressed while within the aura's radius. While suppressed the disease and condition neither progress nor deal damage, but they are not removed.

After the effect ends, the bolus becomes inert. It regains its magic after **1d4 days**, at which point it can be activated again.
