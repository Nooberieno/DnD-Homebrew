### Bloodblade Dance
As an action, you may begin the Bloodblade Dance, channeling a whirlwind of slashes infused with blood.  - Make up to two weapon attacks with this twinblade.     - If at least one attack hits, you may immediately make one additional weapon attack as part of the same action. - Each creature hit during this dance must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC = 8 + Proficiency + Dex) or gain 1 Level of [Bleeding](@/conditions-and-diseases/conditions/Bleeding.md).  **Special:** If you are suffering from the [Bleeding](@/conditions-and-diseases/conditions/Bleeding.md) condition when you use this ability, you make all attacks with advantage during the Bloodblade Dance.  You can use this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per long rest.
