#### **Coleoid Cephalkin**

_Coleoids are stealthy and nimble, relying on their camouflage and ability to squeeze through tight spaces._
It is theorized that Coleoid Cephalkin used to live in the same deep waters as other Cephalkin, but a fearsome predator forced them into hiding in cave system in shallower waters, although no one has been clear about what this predator could be. It is however a common explanation for Coleoid's more pronounced stealth and nimbleness.
