The Cephalkin are an aquatic humanoid race resembling humanoid cephalopods. They have tentacles for lower limbs, dexterous upper limbs, and an innate connection to the ocean. Many Cephalkin are daring adventurers, pirates, or explorers who seek the freedom of the seas and beyond. Cephalkin civilizations are found in deep oceans hidden from sight.

### **Appearance**
Cephalkin mostly characterized by the fact that they have 8 tentacles for lower limbs, their facial tentacles which resemble the facial hair of other humanoids, darker skin tones, which come in variety of colors, that they use to disguise themselves, trying to look like coral.  Their upper limbs consist of dexterous appendages, which at first glance look like arms, but they are way more dexterous and bend in unnatural ways. Cephalkin have five fingers with small suction cup-like fingertips.

#### **Nautiloid Cephalkin**

_Nautiloids have evolved a defensive shell, prioritizing durability over their agility on land._
Many believers of the Coleoid predator theory, say that the Nautiloid's shell is another adaptation to defend from predators. These Cephalkin live at the lowest of depths and have the hardest time adjusting to land, finding that their shell slows them down when walking. Nautiloid Cephalkin often have many facial tentacles, which is often considered creepy by other humanoid races. Nautiloids are easily recognized by the spiral shell covering their heads, which contain and protect their brains. This means Nautiloids will die if their shell is removed. Their shell has made them quite the target for bandits and poachers, as armor created from a Nautiloid's shell lighter and more durable than any metal.
